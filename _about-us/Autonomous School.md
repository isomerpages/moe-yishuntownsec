# **Autonomous School**

Autonomous Schools were established in 1994 to provide pupils with quality education within the framework of a non-independent status but with greater autonomy devolved to the schools. The Autonomous Schools give parents more options in the choice of quality schools for their children.  
  
The broad selection criteria are:  

*        the school has a good system in place to achieve the Desired Outcomes of Education
*        the school has achieved consistently good academic and other results.
*        the school is well-established and receives parental support and public recognition.

The additional flexibility and funding given to autonomous schools have enabled these schools to offer a much enhanced teaching and learning environment to their students. Students also benefit from a more innovative curriculum as well as a more varied and wider range of enrichment programmes. Autonomous Schools have been able to provide a well-rounded quality education that stretches each student to his fullest potential.
