<h1><strong>Our Autonomous School Status</strong></h1>
<p>Autonomous Schools were established in 1994 to provide pupils with quality
education within the framework of a non-independent status but with greater
autonomy devolved to the schools. The Autonomous Schools give parents more
options in the choice of quality schools for their children.</p>
<p>The broad selection criteria are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the school has a good system in place to achieve the Desired Outcomes
of Education</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the school has achieved consistently good academic and other results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the school is well-established and receives parental support and public
recognition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The additional flexibility and funding given to autonomous schools have
enabled these schools to offer a much enhanced teaching and learning environment
to their students. Students also benefit from a more innovative curriculum
as well as a more varied and wider range of enrichment programmes. Autonomous
Schools have been able to provide a well-rounded quality education that
stretches each student to his fullest potential.</p>
