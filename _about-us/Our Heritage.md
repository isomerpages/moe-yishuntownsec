# **Our Heritage**

Yishun Town Secondary School (YTSS) was formally established in January 1986 with Mr Lim Yam Meng as the founding Principal. Commencing with only 9 classes and 13 pioneer teachers, YTSS shared premises with Yishun Secondary School before we moved into the campus at Yishun Street 21 on 31 March 1988. The Official Opening Ceremony of the school held on 29 July 1988 was graced by Dr Koh Lip Lin, Member of Parliament for Nee Soon.

From 1996 to 1999, Mr Ooi Cheng Hock was the Principal of YTSS. Under his charge, the school underwent structural enhancements in 1997 when the previous Bougainvillea Block was extended to allow for more classrooms. This paved the way for a smooth transition into a single session school in the following year.

In December 1999, Mr Tan Teck Hock joined the school as the third Principal of YTSS. During his stint of 6 years in YTSS, Mr Tan implemented various changes including architectural enhancements to create a more conducive and vibrant teaching-learning environment. The new facilities included the Pondok Yidao, the BBQ pits, the eco-pond, the Orchid study area, the Fern Lounge and the water fountain.

Mr Tan Yee Kan joined the school in December 2005 as the fourth Principal of YTSS and it was also then that YTSS was temporarily relocated to a holding campus in Sembawang for a period of 2 years while the Yishun campus began reconstruction under the Ministry of Education’s Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools (PRIME). YTSS moved back to its Yishun campus following the completion of PRIME upgrading in December 2007 and launched the 2008 academic year in the newly upgraded school campus. There were several new additions to the facilities, including an indoor sports hall, an air-conditioned multi-purpose hall and two lecture theatres. YTSS embarked on new frontiers by being awarded the Best Practice Award for Teaching & Learning and the Singapore Quality Class in 2009. In 2010, YTSS was accorded the Autonomous Status.

The baton of principalship was passed to Mrs Tan Chuen-Yin in December 2010. Under her leadership, YTSS has attained the Best Practice Award for Staff Well-Being in 2011.

In January 2015, we welcomed Ms Sharon Yeo as our principal to lead us in our commitment to serve the community and the nation. Under her leadership, YTSS will continue to nurture every YTzen to be a confident leader, active citizen and a global thinker. Under Ms Yeo's leadership, our school's autonomous status was reaffirmed and our school also clinched 4 Best Practice Awards in the following areas: **Student All-Round Development, Character & Citizenship Education, Teaching & Learning and Staff Well-Being & Development.** YTSS was also conferred the School Distinction Award.

  

As we usher in 2021, YTSS steps into a new phase of learning under the leadership and guidance of our new principal, Mr Ng Teo Heng. With him at the helm, we look forward to strengthening the founding spirit of YTSS while embracing and exploring innovations in and outside of the classroom, as we continue to develop all-rounded individuals who excel in and out of the classroom.
