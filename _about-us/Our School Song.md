<p>The school song was created to tell the story of the YTzen, to express
the heartfelt emotions each member of the school feels and conveys a concerted
belief in the common direction of purpose of staff and students of YTSS.</p>
<p><strong>Lyrics</strong>
</p>
<p>Together in work and in play</p>
<p>In all our endeavours</p>
<p>Forward we shall go</p>
<p>With a zeal to learn</p>
<p>An eagerness to serve and a tenacity of purpose</p>
<p>Show our love and loyalty</p>
<p>To country and school</p>
<p>Letâ€™s aspire to greater heights</p>
<p>In all we do</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>Onward, onward we shall go</p>
<p>Yishun Town will excel</p>
<p>Onward, onward we shall go</p>
<p>Yishun Town will excel</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
