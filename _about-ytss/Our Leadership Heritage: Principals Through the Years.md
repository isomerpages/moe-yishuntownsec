<h1><strong>The Legacy of Leadership: YTSS Principals Through the Years</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Mr Lim Yam Meng (1986-1995): The Founding Years</strong>
</p>
<p>Yishun Town Secondary School was formally established in January 1986
under the leadership of founding Principal Mr Lim Yam Meng. Starting with
just 9 classes and 13 pioneer teachers, the school initially shared premises
with Yishun Secondary School. On 31 March 1988, YTSS moved to its permanent
campus at Yishun Street 21, with the Official Opening Ceremony held on
29 July 1988, graced by Dr Koh Lip Lin, Member of Parliament for Nee Soon.</p>
<p>Mr Lim's belief that "our school must provide the most conducive environment
for teachers to teach and students to learn" laid the foundation for excellence,
culminating in YTSS being recognised as one of the Top 20 Value-Added Schools
in 1995.</p>

<p><strong>Mr Ooi Cheng Hock (1995-1999): Building a Pastoral School</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Ooi Cheng Hock's tenure saw significant infrastructural developments.
His belief that "everyone can be a successful individual" drove major improvements,
including the extension of the Bougainvillea Block in 1997 to accommodate
more classrooms. This expansion facilitated YTSS's successful transition
to a single-session school in 1998. The period was also marked by cultural
achievements, including the production of 'A Dream Realised', a musical
drama in 1998.</p>

<p><strong>Mr Tan Teck Hock (1999-2005): Towards Holistic Development</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr Tan's belief in "providing an all-rounded education: heart, body, mind
and soul" manifested in numerous campus enhancements. He implemented various
architectural improvements to create a more conducive learning environment,
including the Pondok Yidao, BBQ pits, eco-pond, Orchid study area, Fern
Lounge, and water fountain.</p>
<p>The school also unveiled a new logo in 2000 and the iconic Y21 Sculpture,
designed by YTSS art teacher Mr Phua Koon Tong, symbolising the school's
holistic approach to education.</p>

<p>Under Mr Tan's leadership and his motto "dare to dream and dare to try,"
YTSS underwent significant transformation. The school temporarily relocated
to Sembawang while the Yishun campus underwent reconstruction under MOE's
PRIME initiative.</p>
<p>Upon returning to the upgraded campus in December 2007, YTSS boasted new
facilities including an indoor sports hall, an air-conditioned multi-purpose
hall, and two lecture theatres. The school achieved several milestones,
including the Best Practice Award for Teaching &amp; Learning and Singapore
Quality Class in 2009, culminating in the attainment of Autonomous Status

<p><strong>Ms Sharon Yeo Eu-Lin (2014-2020): Leading YTSS to Greater Heights</strong>

to realise their potential so that they will live great lives" led to numerous
achievements.</p>
<p>During her tenure, YTSS's autonomous status was reaffirmed, and the school
secured four Best Practice Awards in Student All-Round Development, Character
&amp; Citizenship Education, Teaching &amp; Learning, and Staff Well-Being
&amp; Development. The school was also conferred the prestigious School
