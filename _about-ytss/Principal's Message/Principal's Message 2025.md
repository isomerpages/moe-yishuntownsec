<h2><strong>Principal’s Message 2025</strong></h2>
<h4><strong>The Librarian of Basra: A True Story by Jeanette Winter</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>An Unsung Hero</strong></h4>
<p>True heroes don’t seek the spotlight. One such hero is Alia Muhammad Baker,
a librarian at Basra Central Library in Iraq during the 2003 conflict.
Her name may be little-known, but her commitment to protecting knowledge
in the face of war is a powerful reminder of how one person’s bravery,
resourcefulness, and care for culture and wisdom can make a big difference
to humanity. &nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>The Importance of Knowledge Preservation</strong></h4>
<p>To appreciate the significance of her deeds, we have got to understand
that for most of history, education and books were privileges reserved
for nobles or clergy, with knowledge contained in tomes called “the canon.”
In time, innovations like the printing press—and later, digital technologies,
including large language models (which I partnered to write this message)—have
helped make knowledge widely available. The democratization of knowledge
has been crucial to growth and prosperity of nations. Yet, progress in
education and learning has never been one-directional. There were the four
horsemen of the apocalypse – conquest, war, famine and death – whose coming
set progress back. Specifically in modern days, war still threatens to
wipe out libraries and halt learning whenever it strikes.</p>
<h4><strong>Alia’s Courageous Acts</strong></h4>
<p>When war was looming in Basra in 2003, Alia asked the authorities for
permission to move the library’s collection. “There are English books,
Arabic books and a Spanish-language Koran. There are manuscripts, some
hundreds of years old, on the finer points of Arabic grammar and the art
of telling time.” After being turned down, she decided to act on her own,
ingeniously calling upon friends and family to help. One of them was Anis
Muhammad who owned a nearby restaurant. “I can use these curtains to wrap
them.” “Here are crates from my shop.” “Can you use these sacks?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The books must be saved.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4><strong>Legacy of Preservation</strong></h4>
<p>Alia saved the books from the fire during the war! The building of the
library was eventually destroyed, but Alia’s secret mission saved thousands
of books from the flames. In doing so, she preserved culture and dignity
for humanity. Her story, later told through media interviews and in Jeanette
Winter’s children’s book <em>The Librarian of Basra </em>(which I quoted),
shines a light on an everyday person stepping up in extraordinary circumstances.
For us in education, Alia’s actions remind that the freedom to learn and
the right to read should never be taken for granted.</p>
<h4><strong>YTSS Theme for 2025</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Our 2025 theme is <strong>“Learn. Care. Excel.”</strong> 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I share the story of the librarian of Basra to spotlight Alia’s intrinsic
drive to <em>learn</em>, her <em>care</em> for a legacy larger than herself,
and her resourcefulness <em>par excellence</em>. I hope her story will inspire
our teachers, YTzens, and all who read this message. In the uncertain world,
Yishun Town Secondary School will be a sanctum of learning, staffed by
educators who care, in our relentless pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of recent events that will propel us forward into
2025, in line with this theme:</p>
