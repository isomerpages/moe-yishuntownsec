<p>Welcome to Yishun Town Secondary School (YTSS)!</p>
<p>2026 is a truly special year for our school as we celebrate our 40th anniversary.&nbsp;
Our school theme <strong>“YT40 &amp; Beyond!”</strong>, celebrates our school
journey into a school of distinction – one recognised for academic excellence,
character development, and a commitment to service. We have planned for
a series of activities in 2026 such as Alumni Homecoming Carnival, YT Fiesta
and YT Rejoice for us to mark this milestone and celebrate our heritage
together with our students, staff, parents, alumni, and community.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Beyond Classroom</strong></h4>
<p>At YTSS, we believe that education is not only about outcomes. Our teachers
pay attention to design and curate meaningful learning experiences that
shape curious, confident, and compassionate learners. Through active learning,
our students are encouraged to think critically, collaborate, explore ideas,
take responsibility for their learning and grow to be reflective and lifelong
learners. Our signature Beyond Classroom Week provides our students with
authentic learning experiences outside the classroom to build stronger
relationships with friends and form teachers, and develop a stronger class
and cohort identity. These learning experiences help every child to feel
valued and appreciated, and support our aim of “Leave No Child Behind.”</p>

<h4><strong>Beyond School</strong></h4>
<p>We believe our school experiences must prepare our YTzens for the future.
Our annual Dress for a Good Cause Day lets students experience what it
feels like to be a teacher, and discover what it truly means to teach and
guide others. Our CCE curriculum provides opportunities for our students
to take charge and develop their voices. I am proud to share that in coming
up with the theme of “YT40 &amp; Beyond!”, our students were invited to
share their aspirations for the school. Their aspirations are represented
in the theme’s design. Beyond the school community, we work with North
West CDC on community events and outreach to the elderly living in Yishun,
providing our students with a chance to make a difference to the Yishun
community.</p>

<h4><strong>Beyond Borders</strong></h4>
<p>Through intentional planning, our Internationalisation Programme develops
21<sup>st</sup> Century Competencies in our students. Our students have
opportunities to learn through industry visits, engage in dialogue with
overseas Singaporean communities, and network with international businesses.
Our teachers facilitate guided reflection on these overseas experiences,
helping our students develop a deeper appreciation for and respect of diverse
cultures.</p>

<h4><strong>Beyond Learning</strong></h4>
<p>We empower our students to grow, explore, and find meaning and purpose
in their lives. &nbsp;Our Education and Career Guidance programme is centred
on the 4 ‘E’s – Exploration, Experiences, Engagement and Empowerment. We
work with partners such as Nanyang Polytechnic, Anderson Serangooon Junior
College and Nanyang Junior College to educate our students on post-secondary
education pathways, and the talks with industry practitioners broaden our
students’ exposure and understanding of the World of Work. These experiences
inspire them to aspire and thrive.</p>
