# **30th Speech Day**
  

On 30 March, Yishun Town Secondary School commemorated her 30th anniversary in conjunction with the annual Speech Day celebrations. This year is particularly special as we charted the educational journey YTSS has taken over the past thirty years. We were honoured to have our Guest-of-Honour, Mr Tan Kim Chwee, to grace this event. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  

 
On this day, we acknowledged the excellent contributions by the staff and stakeholders. We also recognised our students’ academic and non-academic achievements. It is also timely to show our gratitude to those who have laid a solid foundation and clear direction for YTSS. Our Principal, Ms Sharon Yeo, gave a fitting tribute to our five former Principals who have, in their own unique ways, built a great school that believes in every student. &nbsp;&nbsp;


The day began with a splendid parade formation by the Uniformed Group contingents followed by the award ceremony. The latter ended on a high note with a creative rendition of our School Rally composed by our alumnus, David Ian Santoso, who performed together with Mr Alan Chew and Jon Chua of 3N1.


With spirits soaring high, the day’s celebrations continued on the school grounds with our very own YT Carnival!  


_“Yishun Town Student Council organised a YT Carnival which featured games booths, a photo booth, free flow of popcorn and candy floss and a dunking machine for teachers. The carnival achieved its purpose of bringing everyone together to celebrate the school's anniversary and making memories together. A limited edition YTSS bear was designed as a momento for this special occasion.&nbsp;This carnival would not have been a success without the Student Council and the team of teachers who worked tirelessly to ensure its smooth operation. Thank you YTzens for joining in the celebrations! Happy 30th Anniversary YTSS!”_&nbsp;&nbsp;
