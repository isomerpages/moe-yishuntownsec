<h3>Mother Tongue Languages in YTSS&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In YTSS, we offer Chinese Language, Malay Language, Tamil Language, Higher
Chinese Language and Higher Tamil Language during curriculum hours.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage all parents to register your child for Higher Malay
Language at <strong>Anderson Secondary School</strong>, as it is the closest
centre to our school. This arrangement will help your child maximise learning
time and reduce the amount of time spent travelling. If you prefer for
your child to attend another centre, please indicate your choice clearly
in the registration form.</p>
<p><strong>If your child has been offered the option of pursuing Higher Mother Tongue, please indicate if he or she will be accepting the offer through&nbsp;the Form SG sent via PG&nbsp;by 23 December 2025.</strong>
</p>
<h3>Exemption from Mother Tongue Languages</h3>
<p>It is compulsory to study an official Mother Tongue Language in secondary
school. For a child to be exempted from Mother Tongue Languages in secondary
school, an official exemption letter from MOE needs to be provided in order
for your child/ward to be exempted from Mother Tongue Languages.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>If your child has been earlier exempted from Mother Tongue Languages in
primary school, the exemption will still be valid in secondary school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child did not take&nbsp;Mother Tongue during PSLE, it does not
automatically mean that he or she is exempted from Mother Tongue Languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your child has been exempted from Mother Tongue Languages in primary
school or did not sit for Mother Tongue during PSLE, please email our Subject
Head (Chinese Language), Mr Lim Teck Chye at&nbsp;<em>lim_teck_chye@schools.gov.sg</em>&nbsp;by
23 December 2025, with the relevant supporting details (e.g. exemption
letter from CPDD).</p>

<h3>Offering of Third Language (Chinese Special Programme/Malay Special Programme/ Japanese etc)</h3>
<p>You will be receiving notification of your child’s application of Third
language via PG.</p>
<p>If your child has been offered the option to pursue a Third Language by
Ministry of Education, <u>please register online at the posted centre's website between</u><strong><u> Friday, 26 December 2025 – Wednesday, 7 January 2026</u></strong><u>.</u>
</p>
<p>Please note that accepting the MOE offer for Third Language does not mean
our school will register your child for the subject - parents must personally
register at the <a href="https://www.moelc.moe.edu.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOELC website</a>,
or the vacancy will be allocated to other students. You may contact MOELC
