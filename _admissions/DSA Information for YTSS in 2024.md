</p>
<p><strong><em>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for throughout their course of study in YTSS.</em></strong>

<h4>Talent Categories</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>YTSS welcomes prospective students who demonstrate talent, passion and
ability in our various talent categories. Successful applicants will join
YTSS in January 2025. Generally, students who are keen to apply should
possess strong level of motivation and commitment to the talent areas,
and in other curricular and co-curricular activities offered by the school.
While achievement level and mastery in their chosen area is key, we are
also scouting for students who display strong potential in their areas
of choice. Our DSA talents should also have the mind-set and learning disposition
to cope well with other aspects of school life in YTSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All shortlisted applications will be informed to attend (i) a technical
trial in the specific talent area; and (ii) and an interview. The details
of the technical trial will be specific to the talent area and made known
to shortlisted candidates subsequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students admitted into Yishun Town Secondary School via DSA will have
the opportunity to be trained and guided by professional coaches, instructors
and experienced CCA Teachers in- charge. Nurturing each individual’s talent
area, the school seeks to provide every DSA student with quality programmes,
activities and opportunities to represent the school in competitions or
public performances at various platforms. Besides development in their
talent area, a teacher mentor will also be assigned to guide each DSA student,
providing them with the necessary supervision in their academic performance.
Hence, every DSA student will be able to excel in their endeavours in YTSS.</p>
