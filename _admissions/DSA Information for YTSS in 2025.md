<h4>Important Information</h4>
<p><strong>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the students’ aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the activities related to the talent they are selected for throughout their course of study in YTSS.</strong>
</p>
<p>Parents may refer to the selection guidelines stated below in the DSA
application. <strong>However, meeting all the criteria does not guarantee the student will be shortlisted/given an offer.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Applicants who do not have prior experience may also apply. The school will assess applicants based on the selection criteria, which may include assessing the potential of the applicants.</strong>
</p>
<p>Application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal.
The application is free-of- charge and will be open from 7 May 2025, 11am
to 3rd Jun 2025, 3pm. For more details, please refer to the MOE website:

<h4>Overview</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>YTSS welcomes prospective students who demonstrate talent, passion and
ability in our various talent categories. Successful applicants will join
YTSS in January 2026. Generally, students who are keen to apply should
possess strong level of motivation and commitment to the talent areas,
and in other curricular and co-curricular activities offered by the school.
While achievement level and mastery in their chosen area is key, we are
also scouting for students who display strong potential in their areas
of choice. Our DSA talents should also have the mindset and learning disposition
to cope well with other aspects of school life in YTSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All shortlisted applications will be informed to attend (i) a technical
trial in the specific talent area; and (ii) and an interview. The details
of the technical trial will be specific to the talent area. The interview
date will be made known to the applicants who have cleared the technical
trial subsequently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students admitted into Yishun Town Secondary School via DSA will have
the opportunity to be trained and guided by professional coaches, instructors
and experienced CCA Teachers in- charge. Nurturing each individual’s talent
area, the school seeks to provide every DSA student with quality programmes,
activities and opportunities to represent the school in competitions or
public performances at various platforms. Besides development in their
talent area, a teacher mentor will also be assigned to guide each DSA student,
providing them with the necessary supervision in their academic performance.
Hence, every DSA student will be able to excel in their endeavours in YTSS.</p>
