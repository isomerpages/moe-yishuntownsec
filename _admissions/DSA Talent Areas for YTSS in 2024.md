<h3>INFORMATION FOR DIRECT SCHOOL ADMISSION 2024 </h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Yishun Town Secondary School welcomes prospective students who demonstrate
talent, passion and ability in our various talent categories. Successful
applicants will join YTSS in January 2025. Generally, students who are
keen to apply should possess strong level of motivation and commitment
to the talent areas, and in other curricular and co-curricular activities
offered by the school. While achievement level and mastery in their chosen
area is key, we are also scouting for students who display strong potential
in their areas of choice. Our DSA talents should also have the mind-set
and learning disposition to cope well with other aspects of school life
in YTSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students admitted into Yishun Town Secondary School via DSA will have
the opportunity to be trained and guided by professional coaches, instructors
and experienced CCA Teachers in- charge. Nurturing each individualâ€™s talent
area, the school seeks to provide every DSA student with quality programmes,
activities and opportunities to represent the school in competitions or
public performances at various platforms. Besides development in their
talent area, a teacher mentor will also be assigned to guide each DSA student,
providing them with the necessary supervision in their academic performance.
Hence, every DSA student will be able to excel in their endeavours in YTSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The selection criteria and process for the talent areas will be updated
from early-May. For more information on DSA-Sec, please refer to MOE website
