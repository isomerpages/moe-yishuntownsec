<p>We are delighted to have you here with us. Here at YTSS, we believe in
the spirit of excellence, the belief that every child can and will EXCEL.</p>
<p>As one of only 28 autonomous schools in Singapore, YTSS has additional
flexibility to offer a much enhanced teaching and learning environment
for our students. Our YTzens also benefit from a wide range of enrichment
activities and a good spread of Co-Curricular Activities, helping our students
achieve a well-rounded quality education which stretches each YTzen to
his or her fullest potential.</p>
