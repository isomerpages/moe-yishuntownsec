# YTSS Open House 2023

We are delighted to have you here with us. Here at YTSS, we believe in the spirit of excellence, the belief that every child can and will EXCEL.

As an autonomous school, YTSS has additional flexibility to offer a much enhanced teaching and learning environment for our students. Our YTzens also benefit from a wide range of enrichment activities and a good spread of Co-Curricular Activities, helping our students achieve a well-rounded quality education which stretches each YTzen to his or her fullest potential.

Whether you are talented in the Arts or Sciences, or have a keen eye or photography or even can spike a volleyball as far as the eye can see, we invite you to come and develop your fullest potential by seizing “Prime Opportunities with us @ YTSS”!

We encourage you to join us during our physical Open House and discover our wonderful world of YTSS – what makes our school feel like home to so many of our YTzens, and we welcome you to join our family of friends right here in YTSS and discover how you can excel! 

At Yishun Town, we are dedicated to nurturing students into future-ready leaders of character and distinction. Our school aims to activate our students’ intrinsic motivation, help them uncover and articulate their strengths and support them to carve out a future of their own. We believe that good character is the foundation of a person. In our achievements, we focused on having good values, and in particular, our school values of integrity, respect, gratitude and resilience. We welcome you to join us and begin your journey to discover what your future will be like at YTSS!
