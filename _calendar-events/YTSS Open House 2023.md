We are delighted to have you here with us and we look forward to welcoming you to Yishun Town on 18 November 2023 (Saturday), 8.30 a.m. - 1 p.m. We have many exciting events, booths and workshops for you to explore! Do note that our workshop is on a first-come-first-serve basis so do sign up [here](https://go.gov.sg/dynamyteworkshops2023) before all the slots are filled up! 

Here at YTSS, we believe in the spirit of excellence, the belief that every child can and will EXCEL. As an autonomous school, YTSS has additional flexibility to offer a much enhanced teaching and learning environment for our students. Our YTzens also benefit from a wide range of enrichment activities and a good spread of Co-Curricular Activities, helping our students achieve a well-rounded quality education which stretches each YTzen to his or her fullest potential.

Whether you are talented in the Arts or Sciences, or have a keen eye or photography or even can spike a volleyball as far as the eye can see, we invite you to come and develop your fullest potential by seizing “Prime Opportunities with us @ YTSS”!

Download our Burning Bright Yearbook & 2023 CCA and Academic Prospectus to find out more on the ways in which our students are embracing prime opportunities to excel at YTSS!
