### CCA Overview

Yishun Town Chess Club (YTCC) aims&nbsp;to develop studentsâ€™ skills in chess and train their cognitive thinking through participation in different types of chess competitions and organising VIA activities for external organisations.&nbsp;YTCC has participated&nbsp;in various competitions, such as National Schools Individual and Team Chess Championships and Chan Soo Sen Cup Graphic Xiangqi and Char Yong Cup Xiangqi Tournaments, giving members avenues to pit their skills against other like-minded chess players. Our students also share their passion for chess to the community, collaborating with My Star Learner to conduct chess lessons for the children.&nbsp;
