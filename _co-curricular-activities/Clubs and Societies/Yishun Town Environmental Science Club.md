# **Yishun Town Environmental Science Club**

### CCA Overview

In Environmental Science Club, our green ambassadors uphold our mission ‘What I stand for is what I stand on.’ We aim to nurture our Green ambassadors to “Learn, Love and Protect” our planet Earth, thereby empowering each of us to be strong advocates of environmental education.

Through a plethora of school activities, learning journeys and competitions, our Green ambassadors learn to develop a deeper understanding of environmental issues and raise greater awareness in our school or community. Learning journeys and workshops are undoubtedly a highlight for our Green ambassadors, as we relish the wildlife observations at various parks and have experiential learning experiences at museums like the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. Hands-on workshops like making Recycled Paper and Upcycled Terrarium have helped our green ambassadors to acquire useful tips on upcycling with a curious and resourceful mindset. Our green ambassadors have also participated actively in national competitions organied by SembWaste Pte Ltd, by initiating projects to promote environmental awareness. We also organize school-wide initiatives to commemorate annual events like Earth Day. The Environmental Science Club collaborates with Nature Society (Singapore) and we have attained Skills Achievement for Novice Naturalist for Birds and Butterflies which have helped us achieve a deeper appreciation of the rich biodiversity in Singapore. As part of nation-wide citizen science efforts, we have been monitoring and contributing data on the biodiversity in our school regularly, which may eventually inform conservation efforts in the region.

With our passion and commitment to environmental protection and conservation, our Green ambassadors aspire to make our actions count towards a more sustainable future.
