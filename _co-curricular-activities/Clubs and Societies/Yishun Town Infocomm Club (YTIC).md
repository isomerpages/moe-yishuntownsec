### CCA Overview

If every great dream begins with a dreamer, then every dreamer dreams because of the love they have for the subject. The Infocomm Club, believes in providing a structure for members to follow their passion and acquire IT skills through experimental learning, guided closely by their motto “Excellence through Dedication and Passion”. The club’s focus then is to help members develop an inquisitive mind and a passion for learning new things. Thanks to the culture of self-directed learning and foundation laid by the club’s seniors, every member is encouraged to pursue their own projects through enquiry and forum discussions to acquire better programming skills. On top of these, members get to go on learning journeys to different IT companies to give our members better insights on the current IT landscape and industrial needs. This year, they will be embarking on a learning journey to CPG Corporation, an architectural company to learn about the use of cutting-edge technology in innovating and growing the architecture industry.
