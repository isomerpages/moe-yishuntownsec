### CCA Overview

Passion. Perseverance. Positivity. These are the core values that shape and develop our shooters’ positive mindset, transform our hearts and minds, and nurture future-ready leaders of character and distinction.

Trainings are designed to improve our physical fitness, focus and resilience, which can be carried over to various aspects of our lives. We believe in every individual and provide various platforms and opportunities to shine by exposing our members to various competitions such as NUS Invitational, NTU Invitational and the National Schools Games shooting championships.

In addition to the shooting trainings, the club participates in weekly mass physical training and games sessions, and termly cohesion days led by the EXCO members. These highly anticipated events aid to forge a strong sense of belonging and camaraderie within the CCA.

At the heart of our CCA are our passionate student leaders who, through their own roles, ensure the smooth running of the CCA and forge a cohesive culture, look out for one another, and work towards creating a home away from home. Leadership opportunities are provided at the Secondary 2 and 3 levels to develop and realise the students’ true potential through the various portfolios.&nbsp;
