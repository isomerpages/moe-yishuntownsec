### CCA Overview 

YTSS Basketball is a CCA that inspires passion, teamwork, sportsmanship and resilience. Our passionate and committed players constantly motivate and encourage one another both on and off the court exemplifying the belief that hard work and dedication are the keys to success. To hone their skills and give our players extensive exposure, they compete at divisional, national and regional basketball leagues, like the Junior NBA Global Youth Development Program and Asia Pacific Youth Basketball League. In 2018, for the first time in YTSS’ history, the B’ Division Girls team fought hard and strong throughout the season and competed at the finals of the National Schools B’ Division Basketball Championships and emerged as runner-up. Our players brought further glory by clinching the Championship title at the Asia Pacific Basketball Youth Cup, where they faced teams from China and Indonesia, to name a few. The numerous wins are a testament of our players’ high level of passion and dedication to the sport.
