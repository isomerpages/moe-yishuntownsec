### CCA Overview

The Yishun Town Table Tennis team continues to make a blaze in 2021 and 2022 with their enthusiasm and dedication to the sport, displaying good sportsmanship. Imbued by their passion for the game, our members strive to give their best in every competition. Every little triumph they achieved in the North Zone and National competitions fired their determination to go further and hone their skills and mastery of the sport. As our Table Tennis members spar against each other during training sessions and work as a team during competitions, they hone their competitive spirit and more importantly, develop a deeper love for the sport.&nbsp;The Table Tennis team also focuses on self-discipline, whereby every member aims to be self-disciplined in their development as a Table Tennis sportsman and in their academic studies. We believe that a high level of self-discipline brings about a high level of focus, which is the key to a high level of achievement. Through day camps and rigorous training sessions, our team members hone their skills and gain confidence, mental and physical strength as well as develop their character.

The Table Tennis team has achieved commendable results in the North Zone Table Tennis Championships and National Championships. All our divisions have done the school proud by showing good team spirit and perseverance in the tournaments. The experiences allowed the players to deepen their love for the game as well as to become YTzens of character.
