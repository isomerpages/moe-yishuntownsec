### CCA Overview

In Bowling CCA, we aim to develop our members to be outstanding sportsmen who display values of discipline and resilience. We promote self-awareness and self-management as bowlers take responsibility over their own learning by striving to achieve their personal best in each training session. Tenpin bowling is an accuracy sport which requires good hand, leg, and eye coordination. Through active participation in CCA, bowlers acquire bowling skills and knowledge and, in the process, inculcate a sense of appreciation and passion for the game.

To further promote sports excellence, selected bowlers will participate in the yearly National School Game, as well as the Singapore Novice Bowling Challenge. With a common goal in mind, bowlers often display outstanding team spirit, encouraging and cheering each other on. As a team, YTSS Bowling continues to grow and become stronger each day.&nbsp;
