### CCA Overview

The Yishun Town Volleyball (YTVB) Girls team is guided by the values of passion, tenacity and commitment. We endeavor to develop skillful, confident volleyball players with a love for the sport and sound character. At the heart of the team are our players; volleyball training sessions not only focus on honing the girls’ skills and techniques, but also on holistically inculcating a set of strong values in them. During training sessions, an emphasis is placed on teamwork and our girls forge a strong sense of camaraderie in the process.

In 2022, YTVB went above and beyond to emerge as 1st Runner-up in the National School Games North Zone Volleyball ‘B’ Division Girls Championship and Top 4 in the National School Games North Zone Volleyball ‘C’ Division Girls Championship. This accomplishment is a culmination of the commitment and relentless effort invested by the girls to hone their skills in the sport. It is a testament of the tenacious and unwavering spirit displayed by our YTVB girls towards the pursuit of their goal to achieve exemplary results. Building on this achievement, YTVB will continue to go from strength to strength to grow as a competent volleyball team where our players embody the values of sportsmanship, resilience and drive.
