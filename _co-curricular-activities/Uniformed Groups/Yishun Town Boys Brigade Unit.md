### CCA Overview

The Boysâ€™ Brigade (19th&nbsp;Singapore Company) focusses on nurturing the Boys into becoming disciplined and respectful individuals who possess sound character and know the importance of giving back to the society. They are also exposed to many learning opportunities that teach them crucial life skills and values like leadership, teamwork and resilience through activities ranging from sports to developmental workshops.

Weekly character development lessons are conducted to build a positive growth mindset and instill good values in the&nbsp;Boys. Through these lessons, the boys are equipped with means and ways to deal with their emotions and make well-informed decisions.

Our&nbsp;Boys also undergo a variety of physical activities that prepare them to face both mental and physical challenges. This allows our&nbsp;Boys to develop their physique&nbsp;and build&nbsp;endurance and resilience. The&nbsp;Boys also attend leadership development courses&nbsp;to&nbsp;hone their leadership skills. Through these courses, all the boys are equipped with leadership skills that will help them to excel both in life and work as they learn the importance of good leadership and the crucial role of being team players.

Every year, the Boys also take part in service learning projects such as the BB CARES and BB Share-a-gift. During these activities, they learn to develop compassion and empathy for the less fortunate by rendering their services to pack and deliver hampers to the needy; to spread some happiness and warmth to this group that is often neglected. Through these various platforms, the Boys grow to become more kind, independent and active youths who are passionate about serving their country and the community.
