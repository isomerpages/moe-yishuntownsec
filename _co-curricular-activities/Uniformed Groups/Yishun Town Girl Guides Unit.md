### CCA Overview

Yishun Town Girl Guides (YTGG) believes in empowering girls and young women to take the lead and be responsible global citizens. We focus on developing girls with strength of character and leaders with confidence, ready to make a change.

In YTGG, our Guides design the weekly programmes and spearhead self-initiated projects during CCA sessions. These programmes stem from our school values and the Girl Guides Singapore core Five-Point Programme. Guides develop valuable leadership and life skills in five areas: Personal & Social Development, Home, Community, Outdoor and International.Overview of the Five-Point Programme
