# **Yishun Town NCDCC Unit**



### CCA Overview

In NCDCC, our cadets learn life-saving skills that make up the Triangle of Life. This includes Basic Fire Safety, First Aid and Urban Search and Rescue.

We learn these skills to help ourselves and others in times of emergency. Through equipping our cadets with these skills, they will be able to serve the community by championing emergency preparedness as first responders.

Cadets also get to visit Civil Defence Shelters, Fire Stations and Disaster Assistance and Rescue (DART) base throughout their journey in NCDCC in order to gain an insight into SCDF and the training our firefighters go through.

On top of that, we contribute to the community during the Service Month by spreading awareness on Fire Safety. We also provide training support in school for our school staff and students. During school events, we are ready to render First Aid support.
