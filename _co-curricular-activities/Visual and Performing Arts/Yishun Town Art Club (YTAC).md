### CCA Overview

In line with our school’s mission to nurture active citizens who make a difference in the lives of others, Yishun Town Art Club (YTAC) believes that “Art is for Sharing”. Over the years, YTAC contributes meaningfully to community art projects such as PassionArts event, The Rainbow Chairity Project and Yellow Ribbon Community Art Exhibition. Beneficiaries of our projects include Rainbow Centre and Thye Hwa Kuan Wellness Centre. Members’ involvement in these projects develops them into socially conscious citizens who share the value of art with the society. External art event involvements such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) art creation, Art Lab and the community art installation by Mandai Park Development at Passion Arts Festival also allowed members to share their passion and talent by educating the public on art-making skills.&nbsp;

Art Club members are exposed to both traditional and contemporary art forms through various workshops and learning journeys. At the Dragon Kiln at Thow Kwang Pottery Jungle, they learned about Singapore’s heritage and culture through a ceramic workshop and a guided tour to the only dragon kiln in our country. Learning how to use Tjantings in a Batik painting workshop also allowed members to appreciate traditional art forms better. Assemblage as a contemporary art form was introduced through assembling everyday objects into sculptures. A visit to the first Minimalism Exhibition in Southeast Asia at the National Gallery widened the horizon of our members’ knowledge about art.  

As exposure to competitions provide members opportunities to expand their creativity, they actively participate in numerous competitions such as the Yellowren Canvas Painting Competition, National Junior Watercolour Competition and Draw My Stamp Art Story Competition.
