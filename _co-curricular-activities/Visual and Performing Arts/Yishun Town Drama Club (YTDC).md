### CCA Overview

Yishun Town Drama Club (YTDC) has been renamed to The English Drama (YT-TED) this year. One of the primary aims of the The English Drama is to develop members into confident individuals who can express themselves in a variety of ways including articulating their thoughts verbally in a clear manner and working together in a group. The twice-a-week sessions focus on various skills and dramatic techniques such as vocal presentation and characterisation.&nbsp;We aim to teach our drama members the different elements of theatre by providing them with the opportunity to work both on-stage and backstage.&nbsp;Besides developing dramatic skills in members, the training given to them also helps to build camaraderie among them.&nbsp;Through these learning opportunities, the drama members develop a love for theatre and build self-confidence in acting as well as speaking in public.&nbsp;The mottos that drama members hold on to dearly are “Always Accept, Never Reject!” and “Always make others look good so that you look good!”

From last December in 2020 to early April 2021 this year, The English Drama prepared diligently and participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation on 12 April 2021. This is a biannual event, which allows them to take their performance to National Level. Our play entitled “Cats-Not the Musical” is an educational and original piece of play that address the cat abuse cases in Singapore. It also speaks about how urbanisation has affected the homes of these cats and how the cats manage to unite and bring their abusers to justice!

Some other activities that members participated in included the CCA bazaar, orientation games to induct new members, open houses and also collaborative camps jointly organised with other CCAs.

Drama members seize every opportunity given to them with courage, resilience and grit.&nbsp;
