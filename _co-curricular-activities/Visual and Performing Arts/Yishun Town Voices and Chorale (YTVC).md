### CCA Overview

The Yishun Town Voices and Chorale (YTVC) aims to develop well-rounded members who appreciate choral singing, music and various arts forms. We aim to develop each and every member to be a Confident, Responsible and Caring Chorister; and our mission ‘United We Stand, Divided We Fall’ helps to remind us about the importance of working together as a team.

We had an eventful year in 2018; with members having the opportunity to create new experiences and broaden their learning. The YTVC staged our first ever concert,&nbsp;_Ubi Caritas: Seasons! of Love, Faith, Hope_&nbsp;at the Esplanade Recital Studio on 8 April, with all proceeds going to the National Children’s Cancer Society. It was a heart-warming showcase to celebrate life amidst adversities. That year, we also had the chance to be part of&nbsp;_OMM10: Mahler 2_&nbsp;at the Esplanade Concert Hall, where we gained a&nbsp;once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with an acclaimed conductor, chorus master and orchestra, as well as to sing with a 200-strong chorus in that performance. The members certainly had an inspiring year which saw them taking on new challenges and widening their horizons.

The Covid-19 pandemic has definitely made things especially challenging for the Yishun Town Voices and Chorale (YTVC) due to the nature of our craft. The initial plans for our Limelight concert at the Esplanade Concert Hall in 2020 had to be postponed indefinitely. However, as the saying goes ‘Life isn’t about waiting for the storm to pass. It’s about learning to dance in the rain.’ We adapted to E-CCA sessions, which included virtual sectional sessions on Zoom; which gave each individual personalised attention and online music quizzes. We also took the opportunity to hone our craft by focusing on music theory and rhythm lessons for face-to-face sessions. With students taking on individual audio recording as part of the new learning modes in this season, it has certainly helped to propel self-growth and inculcated independence and adaptability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
