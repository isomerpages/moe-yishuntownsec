A special co-curricular programme, the Beyond Classroom Week Programme, is part of the schoolâ€™s effort to develop our YTzens into future-ready leaders of distinction and character. It aims to provide our YTzens with authentic learning experiences outside the classrooms to build character strengths, develop self-management skills, build active learning competencies, strengthen bonds with their classmates and teachers, and experience the joy of learning.
