**Sec 1 2022**

For Beyond Classroom Week, the Secondary One cohort had their first day camp in three years since their primary school days. It was
a welcomed experience and the cohort enjoyed outdoor experiences which included kayaking in Sentosa, bowling at Kallang and a learning
journey to Bukit Chandu. They also tried outdoor cooking, a low elements activity and teambuilding games in school. The cohort thoroughly enjoyed the experience and bonded well.


**Sec 2 2022**

The Secondary Two cohort went through a unique YTSS Beyond Classroom Week with activities organised by the different departments which aimed to bring joy in learning and stimulate and enhance YTzens’ interest in the various subject
disciplines. The level also had a class-bonding activity where the students stepped out of their comfort zone and developed their social-emotional competencies and leadership skills. In addition, the students also got to reflect on how they should play the part in their future planning and decision-making. They also had the opportunity to put their learning in practice
through a cohort-based study skills motivation workshop.


**Sec 3 2022**

The Secondary Three YTzens built self-confidence and resilience and forged stronger bonds with their teachers and classmates at the Secondary Three Camp during Beyond Classroom Week. They completed activities such as rafting, hiking, skating, human foosball and the low elements challenge. The cohort also showcased their talents at the level’s Talent Showcase and students got to appreciate their schoolmates’
performances.


**Sec 4 and 5 2022**

One key highlight of our Sparklets’ experience in 2022 was Beyond Classroom Week. The Year Masters took the Sparklets’ feedback and led the spirit of innovation by designing a Beyond Classroom Week that was unique and
different from previous years. The Sparklets experienced primarily an adventure-based outdoor learning programme to strengthen their class spirit and motivation. The Year Masters strongly believed in creating a strong culture of care amongst the cohort as they forged ahead to excel in their national examinations.
