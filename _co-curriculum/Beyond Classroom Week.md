**Sec 1 2019**

Beyond Classroom week for the Secondary One students started off with preparations for sandcastle building at East Coast Park and concluded with the Humanities Alive! program. The other highlights of the BC Week for our youngest YTzens included a Maths Trail at Garden by the Bay and a visit to the National Gallery, Singapore. Be it within the territory of the school or in the heart of Singapore, our students certainly had many enjoyable moments bonding and getting to know their new friends and teachers.

The main highlights of the Beyond Classroom Week for the Secondary 2 were the Heritage Trail at Labrador Park and the 3D 2N at Sembawang Camp Challenge Adventure Training site. Every student had an enriching and exciting time learning about the history and geographical significance of the park. At the camp site, students took part in many new and challenging activities such as high ropes course, dragon boating and the Sembawang Park Orienteering Challenge. It was a wonderful platform for self-discovery, learning about their individual strengths and weaknesses all while bonding with their cohort mates. It was indeed a week to be remembered. 

  

**Sec 3 2019**

This year, the Secondary 3 students roughed it out in a 4 Day 3 Nights Outdoor Adventure Camp held at Pulau Ubin and Sembawang Camp Challenge. The camp served as a platform for them to know their new classmates and to bond with them through various activities like open sea kayaking, orienteering and outdoor cooking. Students had the opportunity to overcome their fear of heights through numerous high elements activities. The cohort had grown closer by the end of the camp and hope to cherish the memories made and new friendships forged for a long time to come!

**Sec 4 and 5 2019**

This year’s graduating cohort kickstarted their Beyond Classroom (BC) Week by spending a day with staff and students from Nanyang Polytechnic, gathering valuable information about the wide range of courses they offer. A series of motivational workshops and learning journeys were organised to help our YTzens understand the growth mindset, gain study skills and discover their individual strengths and interests. 4NA and 4NT YTzens ended their BC week with a 3D2N camp at the MOE Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre at Jalan Bahtera.
