# **Process Drama**

### Process Drama as a Pedagogical Approach

Since 2012, YTSS has been using Process Drama to complement the existing V@H programme. &nbsp;Process Drama provides a platform for participants to discuss and explore issues and problems through fictional contexts. &nbsp;Students learn to think beyond their own points of view, consider multiple perspectives and become active participants in their own character building.
