### Project Schools by Singapore Law Society

From 2012, YTSS has embarked on Project Schools, an initiative by The Law Society of Singapore and sponsored by the Rajah & Tann Foundation, which involves our Secondary Three students. This initiative aims to engage, enable and empower our youth by creating greater awareness of the law, its relevance and application in their lives. 

Project Law Schools highlighted the rights and the obligations of young people under the law, and the consequences of juvenile delinquency. YTzens were introduced to relevant issues such as ‘Knowing the Law’, ‘Cyber Offences’ and ‘Gangs and Rioting’ with the aim of promoting a greater level of civic-mindedness amongst our teenagers, while enabling them to better protect themselves.
