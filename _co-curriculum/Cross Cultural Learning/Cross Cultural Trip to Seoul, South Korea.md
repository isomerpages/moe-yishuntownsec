# **Cross-Cultural Trip to Seoul, South Korea**

The trip to South Korea lasted over 9 days, with YTzens visiting a variety of locations that are associated with the past, present and the future of the host country, which was also the deciding factor of the theme, _Days of Future Past_. The students also visited two schools, Seobu and Pyeong-ri, and experienced Homestay with their buddies’ families.

### Learning Themes and Objectives:

**Student Reflections:**

**Economics**

Singapore can learn to be self-reliant and anticipate its future in the same way that Incheon planned their future and set goals for themselves. Given that Incheon is expanding on their Robot technology, Singapore can aim to achieve similar technological advancement. Since Singapore has limited resources, we should organise learning journeys between power plants of Singapore and Korea so that we may learn to recycle our resources in a more efficient manner. This could also enhance global job opportunities such that Singaporeans can work in Korea. I would love to work in Korea because there are many jobs opportunities like teaching English despite the disparity in languages. However, the cost of living in Korea is expensive and due to cultural differences, there are some daily inconveniences that we have to adjust.

**Politics**

I believe the veteran’s statement that North Korea starting the war as South Korea did not possess strong military enforcements in comparison to North Korea, which would mean that South Korea would lose hands down. It is practical to declare war only if the country has confidence in winning, which includes having a strong military. Therefore, it is not practical for South Korea to have started the war. Furthermore, South Korea was occupied by the USA which was still in the period of policy of isolation and thus, wanted peace and not war. This proves yet again that South Korea did not initiate the war. The veteran also experienced the war and was probably able to interact with the people from the other side as well, therefore the fact that he confidently states that North Korea started the war makes it reliable. However, as the veteran is South Korean, it is most likely that he would not admit to starting the war.

I will fight for a war if the country is somehow allied with our country which makes us obliged to help the country in need. I will also help the other country if the country is desperately in need of help and the casualties are so large that it may lead to a total wipe out of the interest of a large population of the country. This would possibly lead to more unhappiness within the country few years down the road and in this case the total wipe out of the South Korean democratic ideology.  
I will not fight the war if I am the only source of support for my family and if my family is not at a stable state. This is because my priority would be more focused on protecting my family and not another countries’ people.
