# **Education and Career Guidance (ECG)** 

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to plan and manage their career pathways and learning throughout their lives. In YTSS, we believe that ECG is important to prepare our students for the world of work, equip them with the skills to remain competitive in the global economy and above all, to lead meaningful and productive lives.

**VISION OF ECG**

Inspiring Hope & Empowering Passion-Driven YTzens

**MISSION OF ECG**

The school is committed to equip YTzens with the attitudes, skills and knowledge that will enable them to better understand themselves, explore variable education and career options, make informed and sound educational and career decisions and developed plans to achieve their career aspirations through developmentally appropriate ECG activities.

**APPROACH FOR ECG**

The school adopts the school-wide approach to implement ECG in the school. The ECG committee, school leaders, year masters, form & subject teachers, Education and Career Guidance Counsellor and other supporting staff (e.g. Allied Educators) are involved in one way or another in the planning, implementing and evaluation of the ECG programme in the school. We used the 4 ‘E’ approaches to plan our programmes.
