#### **Understanding the YTSS Student Leadership Framework**

***All students***
* Secondary 1 Leadership Training Workshop

***Student Council***
* Planning and Execution of daily duties routine School operations and School Events (e.g. Secondary 1 Orientation, Dress for A Good Cause Day, and Teachers’ Day Celebrations)
* Secondary 2 Aspiring Leaders Programme
* Student/Youth Leadership Convention 
* Student Council Investitures
* Involve in implementation of school processes, e.g. YT Operation Clean
* Self-initiated School-Improvement Projects

**Strategies:**

The SLC seeks to achieve the following aims through guiding and providing resources to the multiple Student Leadership pathways in this School:

1\. &nbsp; &nbsp;To provide resources, training and information to all Students and Teachers of the School.

2\.&nbsp; &nbsp;To assist and implement effective and responsive processes for the functioning of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) as well as&nbsp;the different Student Organisations and Committees in YTSS.&nbsp;

3\. &nbsp; &nbsp;To raise awareness of the importance and availability of Student Leadership in YTSS through involvement in activities such&nbsp;as service-learning opportunities, physical endurance trainings and workshops.&nbsp;

4\. &nbsp; &nbsp;To work together with other School-Wide Committees (Eg: School Safety Team) to aid in the development of our Students in the implementation of School Events.

**Theoretical Underpinning:**

Every building needs a firm foundation. Therefore, to underscore the importance of our programs and processes for Student Leadership in YTSS, we sought to find academics who have researched on the subject and conducted numerous experiments to substantiate their findings. To this end, we have discovered that the deliberations and projections offered by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner in their 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership most closely align to the outcomes we desire our Student Leaders to achieve.  
  
The 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership model was developed 3 decades ago based on exhaustive research. It has helped millions of Leaders gain clarity in their vision and purpose. It also highlights that when a Leader empowers those who follow to achieve their personal best, companies, campuses and organisations anywhere in the world can be transformed. Approaching Leadership as a measurable, learnable and teachable set of behaviours, the Leadership Challenge Framework grew out of vigorous research that first begun in 1982 when Kouzes and Posner set out to understand those times when Leaders perform at their personal best. Through hundreds of interviews and reviews of hundreds of case studies and questionnaires, emerged the 5 fundamental practices, common to extraordinary Leadership achievement. Known worldwide as the most practical model of Leadership development, the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership continues to prove its effectiveness in cultivating and liberating the Leadership potential in anyone at any level in any organisation who chooses to accept the challenge to lead.

**Process:**

**Identification****:**

The SLC has adopted several methods to identify Student Leaders among our Student Body in YTSS such as:

1\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Teacher Nomination   
Nominations by Teachers are crucial in identifying Students who show Leadership potential through their participation in classes and Co-Curricular Activity (CCA).

2\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peer Nomination    
This is an avenue where the SLOs and Teachers-in-charge are able to gain personal feedback of the Students’ perspective and opinion to better identify potential Student Leaders that are well-regarded upon by his/her peers.

3\.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interview with SLO Teacher Advisors    
Interviews are personally done by SLO Teacher Advisors to allow in-depth discussion with the nominated Students so&nbsp;as to better understand the views and opinions of these potential Student Leaders.

**Multiple Pathways:**

The Student Leadership Programme (SLP) has crafted multiple pathways for the Leadership development of our YTzens upon identification and confirmation as Student Leaders in YTSS mainly through:

* Potential Leaders developing through Aspiring Leaders.
* CCA appointed Leaders developing through Empowering Leaders.
* Yishun Town Monitor Council (YTMC) leading up to YTMC Executive Committee.
* Yishun Town Student Council (YTSC) leading up to the YTSC Executive Committee.
* Others: Secondary One Orientation, Secondary Two Adventure Camp, Secondary Three Leadership Camp,&nbsp;Service Learning Projects, et cetera for all Students.
