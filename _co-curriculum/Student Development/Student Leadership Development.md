#### **Understanding the YTSS Student Leadership Framework**

**Rationale:**

The Student Leadership Committee (SLC) strongly believes in a quote once said by John F. Kennedy, “Leadership and learning are indispensable to one another.”  The alignment of our Leadership training programmes is to the “5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership” is critical in the development of our Students to become Confident Leaders.

**Strategies:**

The SLC seeks to achieve the following aims through guiding and providing resources to the multiple Student Leadership pathways in this School:

1\.    To provide resources, training and information to all Students and Teachers of the School.

2\.   To assist and implement effective and responsive processes for the functioning of Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) as well as the different Student Organisations and Committees in YTSS. 

3\.    To raise awareness of the importance and availability of Student Leadership in YTSS through involvement in activities such as service-learning opportunities, physical endurance trainings and workshops. 

4\.    To work together with other School-Wide Committees (Eg: School Safety Team) to aid in the development of our Students in the implementation of School Events.

**Theoretical Underpinning:**

Every building needs a firm foundation. Therefore, to underscore the importance of our programs and processes for Student Leadership in YTSS, we sought to find academics who have researched on the subject and conducted numerous experiments to substantiate their findings. To this end, we have discovered that the deliberations and projections offered by Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner in their 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership most closely align to the outcomes we desire our Student Leaders to achieve.  
  
The 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership model was developed 3 decades ago based on exhaustive research. It has helped millions of Leaders gain clarity in their vision and purpose. It also highlights that when a Leader empowers those who follow to achieve their personal best, companies, campuses and organisations anywhere in the world can be transformed. Approaching Leadership as a measurable, learnable and teachable set of behaviours, the Leadership Challenge Framework grew out of vigorous research that first begun in 1982 when Kouzes and Posner set out to understand those times when Leaders perform at their personal best. Through hundreds of interviews and reviews of hundreds of case studies and questionnaires, emerged the 5 fundamental practices, common to extraordinary Leadership achievement. Known worldwide as the most practical model of Leadership development, the 5 Practices of Exemplary Leadership continues to prove its effectiveness in cultivating and liberating the Leadership potential in anyone at any level in any organisation who chooses to accept the challenge to lead.
