# **Talent Development**

### THE STAR PROGRAMME

(STUDENT TALENT ADVANCEMENT & RECOGNITION)

Vision: Igniting Passion, Sharpening Minds, Broadening Perspectives

The STAR Programme develops in our YTzens the Five Minds for the Future – the Disciplined Mind, the Synthesising Mind, the Creative Mind, the Respectful Mind and the Ethical Mind – which are important competencies for them to thrive in the increasingly complex world. It provides opportunities for students to develop an intrinsic motivation for deeper learning through disciplinary learning.

Lower secondary STAR students will have the opportunity to choose a specific domain in which they would like to extend their learning in. The sessions will focus on broadening and deepening the content, skills and dispositions taught in the main curriculum, with more opportunities for students to discuss, present or defend their points of view and to apply their understanding to real-world contexts.

Upper Secondary STAR students will have the opportunity to choose from a range of department-based talent development programmes over different subject areas and disciplines. Many of them will have the opportunity to represent the school at competitions such as the International Model United Nations Conference and the Mathematics Olympiad.

### The areas of focus for the STAR Programme include:
