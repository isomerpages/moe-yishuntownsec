### Philosophy of Design and Technology Education

  
The motivating factor behind all technological activity is the desire to fulfil a need. The centre of technology encompasses design. The design process in technology is an iterative process which begins with the perception of a need, continues with the formulation of a specification, the generation of ideas and a final solution, and ends with an evaluation of the solution. All design should be made, whether through prototype or computer model, and evaluated. The design activity is made to be purposeful and meaningful. Technology is informed by values at every point. Value decisions may be called for not only in relation to the specific design specifications (i.e. aesthetic, ergonomic and economic judgments, suitability for purpose and ease of manufacture) but also in relation to the rightness or wrongness of a particular solution in ethical terms.  
  

### Mission
  
The aim is for students to foster positive values and develop dispositions for enterprise, creativity and innovation through research and exploration, idea conceptualisation and development, community, working with materials and tools in response to needs identified. They develop the quality of tenacity through continuous refinement of their ideas towards a viable solution with a given timeframe. They will also develop an awareness of design in the areas of social, culture and environment and exercise judgement of an aesthetic, technical and economic nature.  

### Vision

The core belief of YTSS Design and Technology Unit is to provide a platform for the learners to become self-directed learners through experiential learning and innovative teaching. The knowledge, skills and values acquired from design and technology education, mainly consist of three learning domains, namely, design appreciation, designing and making, allows YTzens to cater the needs (PIES – Physical, Intellectual, Emotions, Social) of target users to better enhance their lives.

The key desired outcome of Design and Technology education in YTSS is to realise the YTSS Profile of being A Confident Leader, a leader who is well-informed of the design principles; An Active Citizen, a citizen who can contribute innovative and practical ideas and A Global Thinker, a thinker who is open minded to adapt global ideas to improve the quality of life. The following are the specific outcomes:

• YTzens who can identify different needs and wants and provide effective solutions to improve people’s lives.

• YTzens who can effectively analyse, evaluate evidence and argument, synthesize and make connections between information.

• YTzen who can use a wide range of idea creation techniques, such as brainstorming to elaborate, refine, analyse and evaluate their own ideas to improve and maximize creative and innovative efforts.

• YTzens who can make responsible decision and act on creative ideas to make a tangible solution and contribution to the society.

• YTzens who can communicate visual ideas effectively through sketching, annotations and mock-ups.

  

Through our different subject philosophies, we aim to provide our students with programmes to achieve key objectives. Our Secondary Three Art students went for a learning journey to LaSalle College of the Arts to view an exhibition and continued their trail to SOTA where they managed to learn more about Mrs Candy Tong’s work that was exhibited for the A-Edge Art Exhibition. Our Upper Secondary Art students also attended Art Stage where they get to immerse themselves in artworks that are from all over the world at this prestigious art market. They also got the chance to understand how art transactions were being made and how gallery owners promote the artworks. Our Secondary Three and Four Normal Technical Music students attended music performances at the Esplanade and at Victoria Concert Hall to build their listening skills at purpose-built venues. On the other hand, our Upper Secondary Express Music students took the opportunity to build their confidence in performance by performing during lunchtime concert. Our Secondary Three D&T students extended their learning by attending a 2-day workshop on Autodesk Inventor and Autodesk 360 by learning how to design an aircraft. They also get the opportunity to make their learning more authentic by understanding the application of design during a visit at the Red Dot Design Museum.

  

A group of Lower Secondary D&T students participated in the Tan Kah Kee Young Inventors Award whereby they submitted artefacts and write-ups about their project. During Beyond Classroom Week, our Secondary One students were engaged in ‘Hands-On Marvel’, a D&T based workshop, whereby they get the chance to manipulate acrylic sheet to create a holder for the first time. Our Secondary One students also went to the Singapore Art Museum to be exposed to artworks of different forms while learning about values and culture from Southeast Asia at the same time. Our Secondary Two students went for our SensaYTion exhibition that was planned by Art Teachers, Photography Club teachers and Music teachers. Through the exhibition and performance by Upper Secondary Music students, our Secondary 2 students learnt more about artworks that their seniors and peers had created and appreciate the impromptu acapella by our Music students. To reinforce their learning further, our Secondary One students went for a Sculpture and Music Walk at Raffles Place and Esplanade which was organised by our own teachers.
