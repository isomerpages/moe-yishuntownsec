Food and Consumer Education focusses on Food Studies and Consumer Studies.

In Food Studies, this will equip students with the knowledge about diet and health, so that they could be more discerning in choosing nutritious food for good health and be informed of the benefits of a balanced meal. Students will also be equipped with food management skills where they will be taught culinary skills to be self-sufficient in planning and preparing healthy meals for themselves and their family. In multi-cultural Singapore, students will also learn to appreciate the diversity of food from the different ethnic groups.

In Consumer Studies, this prepares students to make sound food choices and consumer decision in their everyday life. Students will learn the basic principles of understanding consumer rights and responsibilities.Food and Consumer Education focusses on Food Studies and Consumer Studies.
