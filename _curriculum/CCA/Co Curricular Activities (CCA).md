****# **Co-Curricular ActivitiesÂ (CCA)**

YTSS offers a range of CCAs to help students achieve a holistic education. We believe that a holistic education provides students with a broad and deep foundation for lifelong learning. This includes learning knowledge and skills as well as the development of values for each student. CCAs are also key platforms for students to discover their strengths, interests and talents.
