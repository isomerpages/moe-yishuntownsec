### Department Overview

The Craft and Technology Department believes in providing students with an authentic learning experience to recognise&nbsp;their academic abilities and talents. This year, our Secondary One students participated in the D&amp;T Hands-On Marvel Programme. They also visited the National Gallery and NUS Museum to appreciate artworks.

Our Secondary Two students were engaged in music performance in class to deepen and contextualise studentsâ€™ understanding and appreciation of music from local and global cultures. They also attended the SensaYTion Exhibition, a programme put up by teachers in the department to expose students to the subjects.  

Our Sec 3 D&amp;T and Art students went for an Advanced Elective Module at Temasek Polytechnic to deepen their design skills while our Sec 3 Music students showcased their performance at the inaugural NT Music Camp at ITE Central.

  

  

### The philosophy of Design and Technology Education  

The motivating factor behind all technological activity is the desire to fulfil a need. The centre of technology encompasses design. The design process in technology is an iterative process which begins with the perception of a need, continues with the formulation of a specification, the generation of ideas and a final solution, and ends with an evaluation of the solution. All design should be made, whether through prototype or computer model, and evaluated. The design activity is made to be purposeful and meaningful. Technology is informed by values at every point. Value decisions may be called for not only in relation to the specific design specifications (i.e. aesthetic, ergonomic and economic judgments, suitability for purpose and ease of manufacture) but also in relation to the rightness or wrongness of a particular solution in ethical terms.

### The philosophy of Art Unit  

In a fast-changing and an increasing globalized world, we need to prepare our students with lifelong skills of observing, envisioning, innovating and reflecting both in school and elsewhere in life. These competencies will help them cope better with challenges in adulthood so that they respond to them with creative intelligence. They learn these lifelong skills through a thorough and holistic Art Education in Yishun Town Secondary School.

The study of Art as a discipline nurtures creativity and allows room for self-expression and develop traits of mental behaviour that are valuable such as mental flexibility and spontaneity which will help them flourish in a dynamic environment in the years ahead.
