<h3>Department Overview</h3>
<p>The Aesthetics and Technology Department believes in providing students
with an authentic learning experience to recognise&nbsp;their academic
abilities and talents. This year, our Secondary One students participated
in the D&amp;T Hands-On Marvel Programme. They also visited the National
Gallery and NUS Museum to appreciate artworks.</p>
<p>Our Secondary Two students were engaged in music performance in class
to deepen and contextualise students’ understanding and appreciation of
music from local and global cultures. They also attended the SensaYTion
Exhibition, a programme put up by teachers in the department to expose
students to the subjects.</p>
<p>Our Sec 3 D&amp;T and Art students went for an Advanced Elective Module
at Temasek Polytechnic to deepen their design skills while our Sec 3 Music
students showcased their performance at the inaugural NT Music Camp at
ITE Central.</p>
<h3>The philosophy of Design and Technology Education</h3>
<p>The motivating factor behind all technological activity is the desire
to fulfil a need. The centre of technology encompasses design. The design
process in technology is an iterative process which begins with the perception
of a need, continues with the formulation of a specification, the generation
of ideas and a final solution, and ends with an evaluation of the solution.
All design should be made, whether through prototype or computer model,
and evaluated. The design activity is made to be purposeful and meaningful.
Technology is informed by values at every point. Value decisions may be
called for not only in relation to the specific design specifications (i.e.
aesthetic, ergonomic and economic judgments, suitability for purpose and
ease of manufacture) but also in relation to the rightness or wrongness
of a particular solution in ethical terms.</p>

<h3>The philosophy of Art Unit</h3>
<p>In a fast-changing and an increasing globalized world, we need to prepare
our students with lifelong skills of observing, envisioning, innovating
and reflecting both in school and elsewhere in life. These competencies
will help them cope better with challenges in adulthood so that they respond
to them with creative intelligence. They learn these lifelong skills through
a thorough and holistic Art Education in Yishun Town Secondary School.</p>
<p>The study of Art as a discipline nurtures creativity and allows room for
self-expression and develop traits of mental behaviour that are valuable
such as mental flexibility and spontaneity which will help them flourish
in a dynamic environment in the years ahead.</p>

<h3>The philosophy of Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) Unit </h3>
<p>The Nutrition and Food Science unit delivers the Food and Consumer Education
curriculum to the lower secondary students. Our two-year curriculum equips
students with nutrition knowledge and practical skills to lead a healthy
life. Students will learn to prepare nutritious and aesthetically appealing
meals for different groups of people and make informed decisions as consumers.</p>

<h3>The philosophy of Music Unit</h3>
<p>Music lessons are musical, in which the instructional experience revolves
around the music itself. The students should be involved aurally and kinesthetically
in the music. Hence, music lessons need to involve students in as much
music making as possible where students are given the opportunity to listen,
perform and create. Through music lessons, students develop a keener sense
of hearing and gain awareness of the use of music in our everyday lives.
They will then learn to listen with purpose and take more interest in the
culture and society in which we live in.</p>
