### Philosophy of Music Unit  

Music lessons should be musical, in which the instructional experience revolves around the music itself. The students should be involved aurally and kinaesthetically in the music. Hence, music lessons need to involve students in as much music making as possible where students are given the opportunity to:

*   Listen
*   Perform
*   Create

Through the lessons, students will then develop a keener sense of hearing and gain awareness of the use of music in our everyday lives. They will then learn to listen with purpose and take more interest in the culture and society in which we live in.
