### Philosophy

The English Language & Literature Department believes that language is the basis of all communication and the primary instrument of thought in all situations, both formal and informal.  

Activities such as Readers Theatre, EL Reading Programme, Talent Development Programmes and the Good English Language (GEL) Movement are conducted throughout the course of the year for Secondary One to Four YTzens to create opportunities to creatively express themselves. Our programmes encourage YTzens to read widely, speak confidently and write fiercely.Â 

Through the various activities organised in-house as well as participating in external competitions, the English Language & Literature Department aims to help nurture YTzens of the future - confident leaders, active citizens and global thinkers who are proficient writers, confident speakers, critical thinkers and independent learners.The English Language & Literature Department believes that language is the basis of all communication and the primary instrument of thought in all situations, both formal and informal.
