<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>The English Language &amp; Literature Department believes that language
is the basis of all communication and the primary instrument of thought
in all situations, both formal and informal.</p>
<p>Activities such as Readers Theatre, EL Reading Programme, Talent Development
Programmes and the Good English Language (GEL) Movement are conducted throughout
the course of the year for Secondary One to Four YTzens to create opportunities
to creatively express themselves. Our programmes encourage YTzens to read
widely, speak confidently and write fiercely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the various activities organised in-house as well as participating
in external competitions, the English Language &amp; Literature Department
aims to help nurture YTzens of the future - confident leaders, active citizens
and global thinkers who are proficient writers, confident speakers, critical
thinkers and independent learners.The English Language &amp; Literature

<h3>Department Overview</h3>
<p>Creating authentic and real world situations for students to learn and
engage with language is one of the main focuses of the English Language
and Literature Department as we believe that when students are able to
experience and appreciate first-hand the subject matter that they are taught
in the class, they will be able to find the joy in the learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the English Language and Literature curriculum, our students
participate in learning journeys, Good English Language (GEL) Week, Readers
Theatre, English Language Reading Programme and sign up for our Talent
Development Programme. In 2018, the department also organised our inaugural
Get R.E.A.L Festival, to develop a greater love for languages and Literature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the varied pedagogy and learning experiences curated for our Secondary
1 to 4 students, YTzens have the opportunity to explore the different facets
of language learning and literature – reading, writing, speaking and listening.
With the different skill sets students are exposed to, the English Language
&amp; Literature Department aims to help nurture YTzens of the future -
confident leaders, active citizens and global thinkers who are proficient
writers, confident speakers, critical thinkers and independent learners.</p>

<h3>Key Programs / Enrichment for students&nbsp;</h3>
<p><strong>Experimental Learning</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 2018 onwards, the department will be embarking on dialogic pedagogy
in which certain units within the curriculum will be taught through a process
in which teacher and pupils critically experience language learning in
the real world and actively reflect to create meaning for themselves. Students
will engage in exciting discussions and critically assess issues that are
relevant to their daily life.</p>

<p>In 2018, our Secondary 3 cohort embarked on a learning journey to Unpackt,
a zero waste grocery store where they learned more about waste management
and leading a more environmentally conscious lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Program</strong>
</p>
<p>Reading forms the cornerstone of English literacy. Students are encouraged
to read regularly through the activities in the Grapevine Reading Programme:</p>

<p><strong>Reading Programme</strong> - Reading lessons are structured in
the timetables so that there is a time and space for students to discuss
ideas and themes related to a given text. Through thought provoking questions
and class discussions, teachers connect literature to the world we live
in and extrapolate life lessons to make the texts more relevant to the
students.</p>

<p><strong>Good English Movement (GEL)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Good English Movement (GEL) is a whole-school approach which aims
to raise awareness of the importance in communicating in Standard English
and to cultivate confident speakers in YTzens. The movement saw an overwhelming
response and participation in a myriad of activities for students and staff,
including the Instagram Challenge, poem-writing competition, speech presentations
and Readers’ Theatre.</p>
<p><strong>Reader's Theatre</strong>
</p>
<p>The department aims to bring out the confident communicator in all YTzens.
Adopting a student-centred approach, students learn about pronunciation,
enunciation and voice projection through Reader’s Theatre. In Reader’s
Theatre, students experiment with different ways to express emotions and
to understand the importance of having appropriate vocal expressions because
these can affect the impact of the story on the audience.</p>
<p>Before the dramatisation, students need to translate a narrative prose
text to a Reader’s Theatre script. Given the different types of texts,
students need to use the appropriate grammar, tone and register in their
translations. Hence, Reader’s Theatre allows students to acquire both oral
and written communication skills in an engaging manner.</p>
<p><strong>Talent Development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who have demonstrated high competencies in speaking and writing
are stretched under the departmental talent development programme. Selected
students are exposed to community events and prestigious competitions that
aim to hone their communication, critical and inventive thinking skills.</p>
