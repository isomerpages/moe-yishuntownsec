<h3>Department Overview</h3>
<p>Anchoring on the department’s core belief that Humanities is the window
to the soul of humanity, we aim to develop a community of passionate learners
of the Humanities who are critical thinkers and responsible global citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department consciously bring about the exploration process in Humanities
through learning through inquiry. By exploring the interaction processes
between people and their environment, and the past, present and future,
we hope to ignite the passion for the Humanities and allow our YTzens to
acquire skills, values and knowledge and also explore, appreciate and understand
human experiences and the world. Besides impacting skills and knowledge,
it is also the belief of the department that the Humanities education in
YTSS plays an important role in educating YTzens to be responsible and
concerned citizens who understand the various issues, constraints and challenges
that Singapore faces and are prepared to contribute and participate actively
and sensibly in the community and society.</p>
<h3>The department's approach to achieve the desired outcomes:</h3>

<p><strong>A Student-Centred Approach</strong>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>• This approach comprises of Teaching for Understanding (TfU) and Inquiry-based
approach as well as the Skilful Teacher Framework to guide the teaching
and learning process of the Humanities. Using pedagogical approaches like
groupwork, deliberation, and flip classroom, the students are encouraged
to be actively involved in their learning whereby they are required to
ask questions, challenge assumptions, develop their own hypothesis and
conclusions as well as be ready to defend their opinions and judgements
with well-research data, information and evidences.</p>

<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>• The teaching and learning of the Humanities should also take place beyond
the confines of the classroom and textbooks. To bring the learning of the
Humanities alive, the department believes in learning journey such as local
and overseas fieldtrips as well as fieldworks. Such learning journey and
fieldworks help to generate interest, curiosity and makes students highly
involved in their own learning. This will help to enhance their acquisition
of skills as well as understanding of knowledge and concepts. Experiential
Learning also includes cross-cultural learning that will allow the YTzens
to acquire cross-cultural literacies and competencies. Lastly, by sending
YTzens to participate in competitions organised by the school or external
organisations, authentic opportunities are provided for application of
skills and knowledge as well as acquisition of new knowledge and attributes
like teamwork.</p>

<p><strong>S2ED Framework: A department-based curriculum framework that encapsulates the above-mentioned approaches.</strong>
</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/HumanitiesFramework.png">
</div>
<p>The S2ED Framework will provide the guiding approaches and principles
to the teaching and learning processes in the department so as to stay
true to the various disciplines of the Humanities.</p>
<p>The four to five years’ learning process in Humanities is facilitated
through the multitudes of carefully- planned experiences. It is a journey
of discovery via experiential learning, inquiry process, research and investigations
which further develop the talent of YTzens, ignite their passion in the
discipline of Humanities and instil an appreciation of the relevance of
History, Geography and Social Studies in real-life contexts.</p>

<h2>Special Mention</h2>
<p>The Humanities subjects explore the interaction processes between people
and their environment; the past and the present. Integral to this exploration
process is learning through inquiry, a common pedagogy in all new humanities
syllabuses. The department believes in making the Humanities come alive
through authentic learning experiences and learning journeys, to spark
curiosity and interest in our students for Humanities subjects. The department
also continue with the implementation of Geographical and Historical Investigation
at the Lower Secondary level and Upper Secondary Social Studies Issue Investigation
and Geographical Fieldwork.</p>
<h3>Geographical Investigation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In the Geographical Investigations, students have to engage in authentic
real life experiences and interactions in Singapore, analyse the data obtained
and form clear conclusions. For the Secondary 1, the Geography Unit brought
the students to the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital Yishun Pond to engage in water
testing. As for the Secondary 2 , the Geography Unit witnessed the final
stages of weeks-long preparation for the Geographical Investigation of
Yishun estate by Secondary Two students from both the Express and Normal
Academic streams. Students implemented interviewing skills learnt and developed
in the classrooms, and displayed commendable objectivity in ensuring that
they collected data from Yishun residents regarding their favourite places.
Popular sites such as the Golden Village Cinema building, the MRT station,
Yishun Hill and the HDB blocks within Palm Springs Estate were explored
by the students, under supervision of all the Geography teachers. Data
collected through questionnaire surveys, annotated photographs and observations
were then analysed and presented in the form of reports and reflections.
Upper secondary students also got a chance to do tourism related fieldwork
by interviewing tourists at Chinatown and understanding geographical features
at East Coast Park.</p>
<h3>Historical Investigation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>In Historical Investigations, students explore a range of authentic sources
to glean perspectives of the lives of people in the past and infer on life
old Singapore. Students also navigate through various historical sites
in Singapore and encounter authentic learning experiences which help them
connect with their learning. For the Secondary Ones, the Humanities Department
innovated from the original Historical Investigation project and came up
with a Singapore River Trail for the Secondary Ones. Leveraging on linking
the past with the present, the student went on a learning journey at the
Singapore River to answer the inquiry question “Is the Singapore River
a river of life?” For the Secondary Two Historical Investigation inquiry,
the students took on the challenge of answering the inquiry question on
“Did the Japanese Occupation bring changes to the lives of teenagers?”
by leveraging on technology and ICT, the students first learnt about how
the Japanese Occupation changed the lives of the people and shaped their
views towards Singapore. They then dug deeper into the experiences of teenagers
during the Japanese Occupation and how their lives changed during that
period. This was achieved through individual independent research on oral
history by listening to first-hand accounts from war survivors and looking
at other primary and secondary sources like reports, photographs and official
documents to make valid interpretations and inferences. The students then
come together as groups to identify and locate the relevant information
needed for the inquiry question. This culminated into their final product
which is a creative video on their re-enactment of their conclusion.</p>
<h3>Secondary Three Social Studies Issue Investigation&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The Upper Secondary SS Issue Investigation is a form of learning underpinned
by inquiry which are: question-driven and evidence-based, and involves
reflection and knowledge construction. The department focused on using
ICT as a scaffold form of instruction for the students to encourage independent
and self directed learning. Active teaching and Learning are done through
the use of ICT tools and students are expected to collate and present their
findings through the use of ICT.</p>
