### Department Overview

Anchoring on the department’s core belief that Humanities is the window to the soul of humanity, we aim to develop a community of passionate learners of the Humanities who are critical thinkers and responsible global citizens. 

The department consciously bring about the exploration process in Humanities through learning through inquiry. By exploring the interaction processes between people and their environment, and the past, present and future, we hope to ignite the passion for the Humanities and allow our YTzens to acquire skills, values and knowledge and also explore, appreciate and understand human experiences and the world. Besides impacting skills and knowledge, it is also the belief of the department that the Humanities education in YTSS plays an important role in educating YTzens to be responsible and concerned citizens who understand the various issues, constraints and challenges that Singapore faces and are prepared to contribute and participate actively and sensibly in the community and society.
