### Department Overview

Anchoring on the department’s core belief that Humanities is the window to the soul of humanity, we aim to develop a community of passionate learners of the Humanities who are critical thinkers and responsible global citizens. 

The department consciously bring about the exploration process in Humanities through learning through inquiry. By exploring the interaction processes between people and their environment, and the past, present and future, we hope to ignite the passion for the Humanities and allow our YTzens to acquire skills, values and knowledge and also explore, appreciate and understand human experiences and the world. Besides impacting skills and knowledge, it is also the belief of the department that the Humanities education in YTSS plays an important role in educating YTzens to be responsible and concerned citizens who understand the various issues, constraints and challenges that Singapore faces and are prepared to contribute and participate actively and sensibly in the community and society.

### The department's approach to achieve the desired outcomes:

Using pedagogical approaches like groupwork, deliberation, and flip classroom, the students are encouraged to be actively involved in their learning whereby they are required to ask questions, challenge assumptions, develop their own hypothesis and conclusions as well as be ready to defend their opinions and judgements with well-research data, information and evidences.</td></tr></tbody></table>

To bring the learning of the Humanities alive, the department believes in learning journey such as local and overseas fieldtrips as well as fieldworks. Such learning journey and fieldworks help to generate interest, curiosity and makes students highly involved in their own learning. This will help to enhance their acquisition of skills as well as understanding of knowledge and concepts. Experiential Learning also includes cross-cultural learning that will allow the YTzens to acquire cross-cultural literacies and competencies. Lastly, by sending YTzens to participate in competitions organised by the school or external organisations, authentic opportunities are provided for application of skills and knowledge as well as acquisition of new knowledge and attributes like teamwork.</td></tr></tbody></table>
