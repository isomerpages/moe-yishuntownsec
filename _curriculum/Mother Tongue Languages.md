<h3>Philosophy</h3>
<p>Through the learning of Mother Tongue languages, students will gain insight
into the history and culture of their ethnicity which will shape their
self and cultural identity, heighten their self-awareness and give them
a full appreciation of their life situation.</p>
<p>The department also believes that Mother Tongue language serves to impart
personal and societal values to the students. Through appreciation of texts
rich in ethics and values, students learn to be upright and responsible
individuals. Through discussions of current affairs, students learn to
think critically and form their own opinions, at the same time, learn to
tolerate and understand people from different walks of life. It will also
sharpen their cognitive and life skills.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Club</strong>&nbsp;- Reading lessons are structured in
the SOW so that there is a time and space for students to discuss ideas
and themes related to a given book. Through thought provoking questions
and class discussions, teachers connect literature to the world we live
in and extrapolate life lessons to make the texts more relevant to the
students</p>

<p><strong>SCHOOL PUBLICATION (毅意优秀作品集，&nbsp;出版2022年)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mother Tongue Languages Department published a compilation of students
work, featuring good Chinese Language essays written by our YTzens. These
essays are written pieces that students have worked on throughout the year
and serve not only&nbsp; as a form of encouragement to those who have written
these essays but also as a means of motivating other students to continue
writing well and have their essays featured in the compilation in the years
to come and pick up useful phrases and tips while reading too !</p>

<p><strong>Talent Development Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who have keen interest and aptitude towards Mother Tongue languages
are given opportunities to showcase their talents in various platforms
such as participation in various categories of languages and cultural related
competitions at cluster and &nbsp;national level. &nbsp;Our students have
achieved awards for Xin Lei Jiang (Chinese Creative Writing Competitions),
Bilingual Youth Model United Nations Conference,&nbsp;Text Recital Competition
(CL), Poetry Tamil Writing Competition,&nbsp; Tamil Comics Story Telling
Competition (TL) etc. These competitions provide students avenues to stretch
our students potential in language capacity, boost their confidence and
taking opportunities to learn from students of other schools.</p>
<p><strong>Authentic Learning Experiences</strong>
</p>
<p>Every year, the department embarked on rendering YTzens authentic learning
experiences through Lenspeak and News Video Production projects. These
projects aim to inject the element of fun and creativity into the learning
of Mother Tongue languages by making our Teaching and Learning come “alive”.</p>
<p>Guidance was given in the form of feedback on a regular basis where teachers
adopted the conscientious use of the 4 levels of feedback, varied the type
of feedback for respective students at different points of time to level
up their projects systematically. Teachers ensured that guidance and feedback
given catered to the students’ learning pace and needs, making their authentic
learning experience not just doable but a rich and enjoyable process.</p>
<p>For Lenspeak, students were introduced to the concept of telling a story
through the lens (photographs) and words. Various writing skills were reinforced
and students applied these skills to enhance the narration of their stories
through the use of Similes, Metaphors and symbolism. Students also learnt
how to present their thoughts and ideas in the form of photographs and
the use of different angles to look at their surroundings.</p>
<p>Through News Video Production, the department aims to develop in students
various skills such as language skills, computer skills, organising, information
processing, critical thinking, and teamwork via broadcasting. The project
created a real-life context for learning through which students’ confidence,
autonomy, and sense of responsibility were enhanced.</p>
