### Philosophy

Through the learning of Mother Tongue languages, students will gain insight into the history and culture of their ethnicity which will shape their self and cultural identity, heighten their self-awareness and give them a full appreciation of their life situation.

The department also believes that Mother Tongue language serves to impart personal and societal values to the students. Through appreciation of texts rich in ethics and values, students learn to be upright and responsible individuals. Through discussions of current affairs, students learn to think critically and form their own opinions, at the same time, learn to tolerate and understand people from different walks of life. It will also sharpen their cognitive and life skills.
