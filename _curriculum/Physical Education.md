<h3>Department Overview</h3>
<p>The Physical Education Department believes in nurturing physically educated
YTzens who are passionate to pursue lifelong physical activities. Through
various events and programmes designed for our YTzens, we hope to inject
elements of fun for them to experience the joy of learning, and to ultimately
take ownership of their own health.</p>
<p>YTSS will offer Exercise and Sports Science (ESS) as an O-Level Subject
to our Secondary 3 students from 2024. This will provide a good option
for our sportsmen and women to deepen their mastery and expertise. Click

<p><strong>Philosophy, aims and goals of Physical Education</strong>
</p>
<p>The philosophy of PE in YTSS is to encourage participation in a student-centred
teaching curriculum as opposed to a teacher-centred teaching curriculum.
The teacher facilitates learning activities that have the potential to
provide students with a holistic education, thus promoting social-emotional,
physical, and cognitive learning outcomes. The emphasis is on active learning
that involves the processes of decision-making, social interaction and
cognitive understanding for our students.</p>
