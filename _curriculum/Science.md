### Department Overview

In this increasingly technologically-driven world, YTzens need scientific literacy for effective functioning and meaningful participation in society. Many future challenges will need to be approached from a scientific perspective. Science can be used to improve the quality of living through new inventions, new technologies and new treatment of diseases but it can also be the source of many problems. Learning Science will enable them to use scientific knowledge and skills to make informed decisions which are ethically sound and socially responsible in order to tackle these challenges.
