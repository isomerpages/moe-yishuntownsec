<h3>Department Overview</h3>
<p>In this increasingly technologically-driven world, YTzens need scientific
literacy for effective functioning and meaningful participation in society.
Many future challenges will need to be approached from a scientific perspective.
Science can be used to improve the quality of living through new inventions,
new technologies and new treatment of diseases but it can also be the source
of many problems. Learning Science will enable them to use scientific knowledge
and skills to make informed decisions which are ethically sound and socially
responsible in order to tackle these challenges.</p>

<p>The Science department provides a range of activities such as learning
journeys, experiential learning through our Science Exchange Programme
with Sagano High in Japan and enrichment workshops to excite and enthuse
YTzens about Science.</p>
<p>For YTzens who have a passion for Science and want to challenge themselves
further, the Science Talent Development Programme aims to support students
in their learning of Science. YTzens have the opportunities to take part
in Science competitions and in the Junior editions of the Biology, Chemistry
and Physics Olympiads. There are also opportunities for students to engage
in scientific project work investigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>STEM Programme</u></strong>
<br>
<br>As part of our STEM programme, our Lower Secondary students had the opportunity
to learn coding and build their own machine using the Arduino platform.
Some students encountered failure but learnt from their failed attempts.
Some were successful in coding their own machines. All in all, everyone
had fun and learnt a lot in the process

<p><strong><u>3D Printing Workshop</u><br><br>During this year’s Beyond Classroom Week, our Sec 2 students had the opportunity to design their very own perfume holder in a 3D Design and Printing Workshop. During the workshop, students learnt about 3D printing applications and embarked on designing their perfume holder using tinkercad, an online 3D design software. Our students showed creativity in their design and were proud to show off their 3D printed perfume holder at the end of the workshop.<br><br></strong>
