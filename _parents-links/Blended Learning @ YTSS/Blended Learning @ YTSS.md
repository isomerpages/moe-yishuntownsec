# **Blended Learning @ YTSS**

**Rationale**

Blended Learning in MOE’s context refers to the re-imagination of our students’ educational experience by providing them with a more seamless blending of different modes of learning. It allows our educators to re-think curriculum and assessment design, and innovate pedagogies to enable students to benefit from a wider spectrum of learning experiences. One aspect of Blended Learning is the integration of home-based learning (HBL) as a regular feature of the schooling experience.

Blended Learning can further strengthen our students’ ability to be self-directed learners. By mainstreaming HBL we can equip students with stronger abilities, dispositions and habits for independent and lifelong learning, which is in line with MOE’s Learn for Life movement
