### A Programme Specially for Parents and Students of Yishun Town Secondary School

Yishun Town Secondary School has embarked on the FamilyMatters!@School Programme (formally known as School Family Education Programme) since April 2011. This programme, supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development, is part of the school’s proactive effort to empower parents and students with the knowledge and skills to enrich and strengthen family life through the implementation of workshops, seminars and family bonding activities for the parents and students. 

  

**The FamilyMatters!@School Programme includes:**

*   Workshops and seminars for parents on topics such as effective parenting, social and emotional development of children and teenagers, managing work-life demands and building strong marriages;
*   Programmes for students that impart values and build characters;
*   Family bonding activities.

**The FamilyMatters!@School Programme aims to:**

*   Equip parents with the skills and knowledge to enrich and strengthen their family life; and foster better parent-child understanding and relationship to become more effective mentors and coaches;
*   Empower students with life skills; skills to build healthy relationships with their peers and family; and/or imbue positive values and attributes towards family, relationships and life in general.

Parents, you and your family are cordially invited to participate in the FamilyMatters!@School Programme! We look forward to you and your family’s participation.
