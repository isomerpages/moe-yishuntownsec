*   Workshops and seminars for parents on topics such as effective parenting, social and emotional development of children and teenagers, managing work-life demands and building strong marriages;
*   Programmes for students that impart values and build characters;
*   Family bonding activities.

**The FamilyMatters!@School Programme aims to:**

*   Equip parents with the skills and knowledge to enrich and strengthen their family life; and foster better parent-child understanding and relationship to become more effective mentors and coaches;
