 Edusave funds can only be used for purchases facilitated by the school.

 **How do we support students under the MOE FAS and School-based FAS?**    
 Please refer to the funding support guidelines here \[link to document on website\]

 **Will funding be provided for Permanent Residents (PR) and international students (IS)?**   
 Permanent resident and international students who require financial assistance may approach their schools for subsidies to reduce their out-of-pocket expenses.

**Will students need to purchase software for their devices? If so, can these be paid for with Edusave?**

 Students from low-income households will continue to be supported for subsidised broadband under IMDA’s digital access schemes. More information on IMDA’s digital access schemes can be found at [www.imda.gov.sg/ha.](http://www.imda.gov.sg/ha)
