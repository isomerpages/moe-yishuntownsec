# **Parent Support Group (PSG)**

### Introduction

*   Formed in January 2003, we work closely with the school towards the common goal of helping each child to achieve their best by providing a holistic education to the students.
*   We are a group of parents who have children studying in different levels in Yishun Town Secondary School and we come from different ethnic groups.
*   We meet regularly through formal and informal settings to share ideas and suggestions and discuss our concerns on educational issues.
*   Our activities are aligned to the schoolâ€™s programmes and calendar of events.
*   We provide an invaluable avenue for two-way communication between the school and the parents.
*   We strongly support the Family Matters@School Programme.
