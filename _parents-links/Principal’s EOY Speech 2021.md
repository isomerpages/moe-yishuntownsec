# **Principal’s EOY Speech 2021**

2 November 2021 

2022 has been a notable year, with schools all around Singapore adjusting and adapting to COVID-19. Our programmes and activities were designed taking into consideration Safe Management Measures to ensure the safety and well-being all of all staff and students.

We applaud our YTzens for their grit and tenacity this year as they demonstrated their resilience amidst uncertain and changing times. We are proud of all of you!

To end of the school year, our Principal, Mr Ng took some time to address the school and share some of the key highlights of the year.

To listen to Mr Ng’s sharing, you may wish to visit our school’s Youtube page:
