Dear Parents / Guardians

To minimize the waiting time for the purchase of school uniforms and textbooks for 2023, we are encouraging students to make purchase:

* via suppliers’ online platforms with local home delivery or self-collection services (from school for textbooks) from 10 Nov to 15 Dec 2022;
* via appointment at school’s bookshop for purchase of textbooks and uniforms

**\*Students are encouraged to purchase their items early to avoid overcrowding at retail outlets. Sale of school uniforms and textbooks in school between 27 Dec and 30 Dec 2022 are strictly for 2023 Sec 1 cohort.**
