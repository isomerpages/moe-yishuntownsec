### Exemption from Mother Tongue Languages

It is compulsory to study an official Mother Tongue Language in secondary school. For a child to be exempted from Mother Tongue Languages in secondary school, an official exemption letter from MOE needs to be provided in order for your child/ward to be exempted from Mother Tongue Languages.

  

1.   If your child has been earlier exempted from Mother Tongue Languages in primary school, the exemption will still be valid in secondary school.

2.   If your child did not take  Mother Tongue during PSLE, it does not automatically mean that he or she is exempted from Mother Tongue Languages.

3.   Should your child not take Mother Tongue in secondary school, he or she will not be eligible to apply for entry into a junior college at the end of his or her O Level examinations.  

**  
If your child has been exempted from Mother Tongue Languages in primary school or did not sit for Mother Tongue during PSLE, please email our Subject Head (Chinese Language), Mr Lim Teck Chye at [lim\_teck\_chye@schools.gov.sg](mailto:lim_teck_chye@schools.gov.sg) by 28 December 2022, 12 p.m. with relevant supporting details (e.g. exemption letter from CPDD).**
