Dear Parents and Guardians,  
  
Welcome to Yishun Town Secondary School (YTSS)!  
  
We are sure that you and your child/ward are very excited to start this new chapter of his or her life and we are equally excited to welcome you into our big YTSS family.  
  
In YTSS, we use the Parents' Gateway (PG) application as our primary mode of communication with parents and we would like to encourage you to download the application if you have not already done so. A PG message will be sent to you by the end of Wednesday, 21 December 2022. For more information on using PG,Â [please refer to our User Guide via this link.](https://yishuntownsec.moe.edu.sg/parents-links/parents-gateway)  
  
To help you and your child transition into secondary school, we would like to ask that you take some time to read through the information on Secondary 1 Registration on our webpage.
