# **Sec 1 Orientation Programme 2023**  

### _"Where do I need to go? How do I get there?"  
"Where is my class?"  
"What if I need help?"  
"I don't know anyone from my primary school here!"_

It is not unusual to hear some of these questions being asked on the first day of school. After all, starting secondary school can be an awfully daunting task for many students. It is completely normal to feel lost, confused and worried as there are so many unknowns. It is with this understanding in mind that our Student Councillors have designed and put together a suite of activities to help our newly-minted YTzens feel more at ease and comfortable in their new surroundings.
