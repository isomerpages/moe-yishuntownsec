# **Parent Support Group (PSG)**

### Introduction

*   Formed in January 2003, we work closely with the school towards the common goal of helping each child to achieve their best by providing a holistic education to the students.
*   We are a group of parents who have children studying in different levels in Yishun Town Secondary School and we come from different ethnic groups.
*   We meet regularly through formal and informal settings to share ideas and suggestions and discuss our concerns on educational issues.
*   Our activities are aligned to the school’s programmes and calendar of events.
*   We provide an invaluable avenue for two-way communication between the school and the parents.
*   We strongly support the Positive Parenting Programme for parents.

###  Positive Parenting Programme

In order to support parents in building a healthy relationship with their child, our school embarks on the Positive Parenting Programme (**Triple P**) from this year. This programme is supported by Ministry of Social and Family Development and it is now used in 17 countries worldwide.

**Triple P**&nbsp;helps our students’ parents:

* Create a stable, supportive, harmonious family environment
* Teach their children the skills they need to get along with others
* Deal positively, consistently and decisively with problem behaviour should it arise
* Encourage behaviour they like
* Develop realistic expectations of their children and themselves
* Take care of themselves as parents

All Sec 1 to Sec 5 parents are eligible to participate in this programme. The information is sent out via Parent Gateway at certain points of every year.

###  Other useful information for parents
MOE will be rolling out a series of engagement sessions titled “A World Beyond School”. These sessions comprise dialogues and conversations where parents, educators and students can gain insights on the diverse work realities and be enriched by learning experiences beyond schools. We have attached the schedule of upcoming sessions, and details of each session will be shared on MOE platforms closer to the dates.
