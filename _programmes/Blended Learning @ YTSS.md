<h1><strong>Blended Learning @ YTSS</strong></h1>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong>
</p>
<p>Blended Learning in MOE’s context refers to the re-imagination of our
students’ educational experience by providing them with a more seamless
blending of different modes of learning. It allows our educators to re-think
curriculum and assessment design, and innovate pedagogies to enable students
to benefit from a wider spectrum of learning experiences. One aspect of
Blended Learning is the integration of home-based learning (HBL) as a regular
feature of the schooling experience.</p>
<p>Blended Learning can further strengthen our students’ ability to be self-directed
learners. By mainstreaming HBL we can equip students with stronger abilities,
dispositions and habits for independent and lifelong learning, which is
in line with MOE’s Learn for Life movement</p>
