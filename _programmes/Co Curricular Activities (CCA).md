<p>YTSS offers a range of CCAs to help students achieve a holistic education.
We believe that a holistic education provides students with a broad and
deep foundation for lifelong learning. This includes learning knowledge
and skills as well as the development of values for each student. CCAs
are also key platforms for students to discover their strengths, interests
and talents.</p>
