<h1><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h1>
<h2>Device</h2>
<p><strong>Will there be digital versions for all textbooks? Will students be asked to buy only digital versions of textbooks?</strong>
<br>&nbsp;Print textbooks and workbooks will continue to be the primary method
for the delivery of the curriculum in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Can students opt not to purchase the device?</strong>
<br>Every student is required to have a device for teaching and learning purposes
and is encouraged to purchase one through the school.</p>
<p>Students who do not wish to purchase a device because they already have
their own device will have to (i) check that the specification of their
device meet the device requirement of the school (refer to Device Requirement
document) and (ii) agree to the installation of DMA on their device, before
they can pursue this option.</p>
<p>Upon approval, the school will assist to install the DMA in the student’s
existing device, which will be uninstalled from the device upon the student’s
graduation.</p>
<p><strong>What is the expected shelf life of the device? What happens to the device after the student graduates?</strong>
<br>The devices have an average shelf life of 3-4 years, to cover the time
a student is in secondary school. The school will uninstall the Device
Management Application (DMA) from the devices upon students’ graduation,
and students will have full control over their devices afterward. If the
student’s device needs to be installed with DMA in JC/MI, it can be reinstated.</p>
<p><strong>Will students be allowed to store the devices in school overnight? Where will students store their devices when they go for recess or PE lessons?</strong>
<br>Students are expected to lock their devices in their own individual lockers
in their classroom. The classroom will be locked at the end of each day.
Students should bring the devices home at the end of the school day so
that they can utilise them for learning at home.</p>
<p><strong>Do parents or students have to bring their device down to the service centre for repairs? Are there other options?</strong>
<br>In the event that the student’s device is faulty, parents can choose to
send the device directly to the vendor for repair or leave the device with
the school for the vendor to pick up via a fortnightly courier service.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be vendor support if parents have issues with the device?</strong>
<br>Yes, individual vendors will be sharing their support information on their
websites. This information will be provided to parents closer to the issue
of the PLD.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the device is stolen/lost? Does the contract include insurance? If so, what is covered under the insurance?</strong>
<br>The device will come with the enhanced device bundle which is inclusive
of 3-year insurance and 3- year warranty.</p>
<p>The insurance coverage is only applicable to situations of damages and
loss where the student has taken precautions to safeguard the device.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if students damage their devices accidentally?</strong>
<br>If the devices are damaged, the parents/students can report it to the
school. The school will coordinate with the vendor on the assessment of
damage and repairs. If there are additional costs, the vendor will contact
the parents/students before proceeding with the repair. Edusave funds cannot
be used to pay for the cost of repairs.</p>
<p><strong>When a student’s device is not able to function or is lost, are they able to loan a school device from school for short-term use?</strong>
<br>Students will be able to get a short-term loan of device (subjected to
availability) due to loss or repairs.</p>
<p><strong>Does the insurance cover the accessories (e.g. styluses, keyboard cases)?</strong>
<br>Insurance coverage is for the main device only and does not cover accessories.</p>
<p><strong>Can students share one device with their siblings?</strong>
<br>For a smooth learning experience, each student should have his/her own
device as prescribed by the school. This is because different schools may
tap on different devices for teaching and learning. In addition, students
will be required to use the devices in school daily and for their learning
after school, hence it might not be practical to share the device with
their siblings.</p>
<p><strong>What is included with the purchase of the device?</strong>
<br>The device will come with the enhanced device bundle with 3-year insurance
and 3-year warranty, which allows for two repairs or one replacement.</p>
<p>The insurance coverage is only applicable to situations of damages and
loss where the student has taken precautions to safeguard the device.</p>
<p><strong>Can parents collect the device on the student’s behalf?</strong>
<br>Parent can collect the device personally or via an adult proxy. When the
devices are delivered to the school, students will be collecting the devices
on behalf of parents if parents have authorised their child to do so.</p>
<p>Please contact the school via the PDLP support email for further advice
or clarification if you would like to make this arrangement.</p>
<h2>DMA</h2>
<p><strong>Is the DMA installation compulsory for all students?</strong>
<br>All PLDs purchased through the school will be installed with DMA before
they are issued to students. Parents who wish to use existing home digital
devices may do so. Such devices will have to meet the necessary school
specifications (refer to Device Requirement document) and have the DMA
installed. This is to ensure that the device can be used securely in the
school. The school will also uninstall the DMA from the students’ devices
upon graduation.</p>
<p><strong>Why is there a need for Device Management Application (DMA) in Personal Learning Devices (PLDs)?</strong>
<br>The DMA allowed teachers to have appropriate controls in place to manage
students’ device usage in classrooms. The DMA also will be able to address
concerns about access to undesirable content online (e.g. pornography,
gambling etc) and excessive screen time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>What are the benefits of installing DMA in the PLDs when students still have unlimited access to their mobile phones and/or other existing devices?</strong>
<br>The PLD is intended to be a device primarily for teaching and learning.
The DMA restrictions create a safe and conducive digital environment, with
fewer distractions such as social media and games that might otherwise
detract from students’ learning. This is distinct from students’ other
devices, including mobile phones, which are more typically used for leisure
purposes.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to the DMA when a student leaves secondary school?</strong>
<br>When students graduate from secondary school, the school will uninstall
the DMA from their PLDs. Students will have full control over their PLDs,
with no restrictions.</p>
<h2>Cyber Wellness</h2>
<p><strong>How is MOE helping my child to manage possible cyber risks?</strong>
<br>The new CCE 2021 syllabus will feature cyber-wellness education more strongly,
with updated authentic scenarios used, to better equip students to navigate
online spaces safely and help develop a more supportive cyber environment.
Cyber Wellness education programmes in school will also teach students
how to take responsibility for their online well-being, and how to be positive
role models to others in creating safe and kind online communities.</p>
<h2>School Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Will students need to bring the device to school everyday?</strong>
<br>Students should bring their PLDs everyday as the PLD is intended for use
during lessons.</p>
<p><strong>Will students be able to charge the device in school?</strong>
<br>All students are strongly encouraged to bring their PLDs home to charge
every night. However, there will be a charging cabinet provided for emergency
charging of PLDs.</p>
<p>Funding and Other Support</p>
<p><strong>Can students use their Edusave funds to purchase devices from vendors not engaged by the school?</strong>
<br>&nbsp;Edusave funds can only be used for purchases facilitated by the
school.</p>
<p><strong>How do we support students under the MOE FAS and School-based FAS?</strong>
<br>Please refer to the funding support guidelines&nbsp;here:&nbsp;<a href="/files/Financial_Assistance_for_PLD_2025.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">2025 Financial Assistance for PLD</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Will funding be provided for Permanent Residents (PR) and international students (IS)?</strong>
<br>&nbsp;Permanent residents and international students who require financial
assistance may approach their schools for subsidies to reduce their out-of-pocket
expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Will students need to purchase software for their devices? If so, can these be paid for with Edusave?</strong>
<br>The school will install the necessary software with enterprise licenses
to enable use of software with students’ devices. Students need not pay
for the purchase of software for their PLDs.</p>
<p><strong>How will students without internet access at home be supported?</strong>
<br>Students from low-income households will continue to be supported for
subsidised broadband under IMDA’s digital access schemes. More information
on IMDA’s digital access schemes can be found <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/digital-access-at-home" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>
