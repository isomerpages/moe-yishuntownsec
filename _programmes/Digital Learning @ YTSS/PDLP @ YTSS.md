<h1><strong>PDLP @ YTSS</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>NATIONAL DIGITAL LITERACY PROGRAMME (NDLP)</strong></h3>
<p>In March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP)
for all schools to equip our students with digital literacies.</p>
<p>Digital Literacies better enable our students, at different stages of
their education journey, to acquire the digital skills required to navigate
the digital age through four mutually reinforcing components in the ‘Find,
Think, Apply and Create’ framework.</p>

<h3><strong>PERSONAL LEARNING DEVICE (PLD)</strong></h3>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is to introduce the Personalised Digital
Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every
secondary school student will own a Personal Learning Device (PLD). PLDs
provide an immersive environment for students to develop the dispositions,
knowledge and skills to thrive in the digital environment.</p>
