National Day 2016: Celebrating our past successes, anticipating a bright future    
  

One year after the euphoric SG50 National Day celebrations, YTSS celebrated National Day on home ground, at the Parade Square. Mr Joe Goh, our school SAC Chairperson graced our school’s NDP celebrations as the Guest-Of-Honour. The school witnessed a parade led by the National Cadet Corps together with the other Gold Award winning Uniform Groups. Celebrations began in full fervour when our cadets kick-started the event with a well-coordinated parade. The performance segment was a manifestation of the vibrance of youth and diversity of Singapore. The Choir members brought the crowd down memory lane with a sing-along session to evergreen National Day songs like ‘Home’ and ‘Count on Me, Singapore’. The celebrations then concluded on a high note, leaving everyone invigorated in spirit.

  

Members of the YTSS fraternity share their thoughts and well-wishes for Singapore:  

  

_‘NDP is an annual event I anticipate eagerly. The Uniform Groups’ marching parade, to me, is the highlight of the whole parade. Seeing the cadets march with pride and zest, showed how proud they were to serve the school and nation. I was pleasantly moved by the level of resilience displayed by the NPCC cadets who continued their performance even in the face of technical issues. The extent of their resilience was exuded when they did not decline a second chance to perform with the music.’_

 _‘National Day Celebration in YTSS was significant to me as I was with the Acapella choir and saw the students from the choir who were involved in the performance segment grow in strength, which was heartening. Overall, the NDP is an occasion for us to foster a stronger sense of appreciation for our country and treasure what history has given us.’_
