# **Sec 2 Parent Teacher Rapport Session, 11 Mar 2022**

Yishun Town Secondary School will be holding our Sec 2 Parents’ Engagement Session this Friday, 11 March 2022.

It will be an informative session which will also give you a preview to the different subject combinations that will potentially be offered to your chid/ward at the end of Sec 2. This will be followed by an interaction session with your child/ward's Form Teachers.

The details for the session are as follows:
