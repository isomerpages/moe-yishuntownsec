This year, the theme for the 36th Speech Day is "Burning Bright", symbolising the school's resilience in our journey towards excellence amidst adversity.   
  
The details of the session are as follows: 
**Topic:** YTSS 36th Speech Day Celebration    
**Date:** 14 April 2022, Thursday   
**Time:** 2 p.m. - 4.15 p.m.   
  
Our students will be dismissed earlier on that day at 12.10 p.m. to proceed home. To encourage whole-school involvement to celebrate this milestone, the school has designed this celebration into a Character and Citizenship Education Masterclass on Student Learning Space where students will experience inspiring stories of bravery, passion, resilience and excellence shown by YTzens. Upon returning to school, they will also be enjoying snippets of the Speech Day event during their Home Room periods.
