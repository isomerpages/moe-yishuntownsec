### Welcome to Yishun Town Secondary School’s (YTSS) Open House 2022!

We are delighted to have you here with us! Here at YTSS, we are dedicated to creating new possibilities and experiences for our students and we hope you will be open to imagining a future @ YTSS!

As an autonomous school, YTSS has additional flexibility to offer a much enhanced teaching and learning environment for our students. Our YTzens also benefit from a wide range of enrichment activities and a good spread of Co-Curricular Activities, helping our students achieve a well-rounded quality education which stretches each YTzen to his or her fullest potential.

Whether you are talented in the Arts or Sciences, or have a keen eye or photography or even can spike a volleyball as far as the eye can see, come **“Imagine Your Future with us @ YTSS”**!

We are dedicated to nurturing students into future-ready leaders of character and distinction. Our school aims to activate our students’ intrinsic motivation, help them uncover and articulate their strengths and support them to carve out a future of their own. We believe that good character is the foundation of a person. In our achievements, we focused on having good values, and in particular, our school values of integrity, respect, gratitude and resilience. 

We welcome you to join us and begin your journey to discover what your future will be like at YTSS!
