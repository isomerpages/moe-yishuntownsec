# **30th Anniversary Homecoming Dinner**

  

A gala co-organised by the YTSS Alumni and the School, this activity was meant for our alumni to revel in YTSS 30th Anniversary celebrations. With activities such as a grand tour of the school to rekindle nostalgic feelings in the guests, a ‘live’ photobooth with props and school uniforms for a good dose of fun was set up. Our former students took home with them memorabilia that encapsulated the memories created that night. Over a gastronomic spread of food, former staff and students with current staff and students, bonded and re-lived the good ol’ days. The special appearance of YTSS’s past principals was the highlight of the night which accounted the overwhelming response for the purchase of event tickets.
  

_‘The event certainly brought a flavourful mix of pride in seeing our ex-students doing well in their lives and sheer joy in catching up with ex-colleagues who have moved on in life as well. Most of all, I think the entire activity confirmed the primary purpose of YTSS&nbsp; -&nbsp; a future-centric approach in developing students ready for the future by equipping them with skills and building in them resilience to achieve success. We Will Excel!’_ &nbsp;&nbsp;

_‘The 30th Homecoming dinner was filled with snapshot moments for me. Face-to-face encounters with former principals, colleagues and students, some of whom came with their children in tow – filled the moments with fun and deep emotions. It was a walk down memory lane when students recalled instances when advice was given to them to pick themselves up when the going seemed tough. Once again, I was reminded of how the teacher’s impact on a child is felt long after the child has walked out through the gates of the school. &nbsp;As my students clamoured around me for photos, I gushed at the momentary celebrity-status they accorded me while acceding to their request. I hope this tradition of having a homecoming event can continue well into the future as YTSS becomes well-established. It is through opportunities like these that stakeholders of the school can build a lasting relationship between them and the school.’_&nbsp;
