# **CCA Excellence**

A total of four awards from the four CCA categories will be awarded to the Most Balanced All-Rounder YTzens in the school.

YTzens do not only excel in ability, effort, attendance and leadership. In their CCAs, they are also good team-players who promote the love for their CCA and give their best for the school.
